<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>I am unwilling that this volume should go forth to
the world without some account of its origin and
of its contents.</p>

<p>I. Appointed last year, (without solicitation on his
part,) to the office of Select Preacher, the present
writer was called upon at the commencement of the
October Term to address the University. His Sermon,
(the first in the volume,) was simply intended to embody
the advice which he had already orally given
to every Undergraduate who had sought counsel at
his hands for many years past in Oxford; advice
which, to say the truth, he was almost weary of repeating.
Nothing more weighty or more apposite, at
all events, presented itself, for an introductory address:
nor has a review of the current of religious
opinion, either before or since, produced any change
of opinion as to the importance of what was on that
first occasion advocated.</p>

<p>Another, and another, and yet another preaching
turn unexpectedly presented itself, in the course of
the same Term; and the IInd, IIIrd, and IVth of the
ensuing Sermons, (preached on alternate Sundays,)
were the result. The study of the Bible had been
advocated in the first Sermon; but it was urged from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_viii" id="Preface_Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>a hundred quarters that a considerable amount of unbelief
prevailed respecting that very Book for which
it was evident that the preacher claimed entire perfection
and absolute supremacy. The singular fallacy
of these last days, that Natural Science, in some unexplained
manner, has already demolished,&mdash;or is inevitably
destined to demolish<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,&mdash;the Book of Divine
Revelation, appeared to be the fallacy which had
emerged into most offensive prominence; and to this,
he accordingly addressed himself.&mdash;It will not, surely,
be thought by any one who reads the IInd of these
Sermons that its author is so weak as to look with
jealousy on the progress of Physical Science. His
alarm does not arise from the cultivation of the noblest
study but one,&mdash;viz. the study of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Works; but
from the prevalent <i>neglect of the noblest study of all</i>,&mdash;viz.
<i>the study of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word</i>. His quarrel is not
with the Professors of Natural Science, but with those
who are mere <i>Pretenders</i> to it. Moreover, he makes
no secret of his displeasure at the undue importance
which has of late been claimed for Natural Science;
and which is sufficiently implied by the prevalent
fashion of naming it without any distinguishing epithet,&mdash;as
"Science," absolutely: just as if <i>Theology</i>
were not a Science also<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>!</p>

<p>It is not necessary to speak particularly of the contents
of the next two Sermons; except to say that
the train of thought thus started conducted the author
inevitably over ground which was already occupied
in the public mind by a volume which had already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_ix" id="Preface_Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>obtained some notoriety, and which has since become
altogether infamous. Enough of the contents of that
unhappy production I had read to be convinced that
in a literary, certainly in a <i>Theological</i> point of view,
it was a most worthless performance; and I recognized
with equal sorrow and alarm that it was but the matured
expression of opinions which had been fostering
for years in certain quarters: opinions which, occasionally,
had been ventilated from the University
pulpit; or which had been deliberately advocated in
print<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; and which it was now hinted were formidably
maintained, and would be found hard to answer. Astonished,
(not by any means for the first time in my
life,) at the apathy which seemed to prevail on questions
of such vital moment, I determined at all events
not to be a party to a craven silence; and denounced
from the University pulpit with hearty indignation
that whole system of unbelief, (if system it can be
called,) which has been growing up for years among
us<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; and which, I was and am convinced, must be
openly met,&mdash;not silently ignored until the mischief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_x" id="Preface_Page_x">[x]</a></span>becomes unmanageable: met, too, by building up
men in <span class="smcap">the Truth</span>: above all, by giving Theological
instruction to those who are destined to become Professors
of Theological Science, and are about to undertake
the cure of souls.... In this spirit, I asserted
the opposite fundamental verities; and so, would have
been content to dismiss the "Essays and Reviews"
from my thoughts for ever.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, the respectability of the authors
of that volume had attracted to their work an
increasing share of notice. An able article in the
'Westminster Review' first aroused public attention.
A still abler in the 'Quarterly' awoke the Church to
a sense of the enormity of the offence which had been
committed. It was not that <i>danger</i> was apprehended.
There could be but one opinion as to the essential impotence
of the attack. But the circumstances which
aroused public indignation were twofold. First,&mdash;Here
was a <i>conspiracy</i> against the Faith. Seven
Critics had <i>avowedly combined</i> "to illustrate the advantage
derivable to the cause of Religious and Moral
Truth from a free handling, in a becoming spirit, of"
what they were pleased to characterize as "subjects
peculiarly liable to suffer by the repetition of conventional
language, and from traditional modes of
treatment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>." They prefixed to their joint labours the
expression of a "hope that their volume would be received
as an attempt" to do this. That their allusion
was to the Creeds, Articles, Book of Common Prayer
and Administration of the Sacraments,&mdash;was obvious.
Equally obvious was the <i>un</i>-becoming spirit, the arrogance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xi" id="Preface_Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>and the hostility,&mdash;with which all those sacred
things were handled by those seven writers.</p>

<p>Secondly,&mdash;"Essays and Reviews" attracted notice
because six of its authors were <i>Ministers of the Church
of England</i>. Here were six Clergymen openly making
light of their sacred profession, and apparently worse
than regardless of their Ordination vows. As an infidel
but certainly in this instance most truthful as
well as able Reviewer, remarked concerning the work
in question,&mdash;"In their ordinary, if not plain sense,
there has been discarded the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the Creation,
the Fall, the Redemption, Justification, Regeneration,
and Salvation, Miracles, Inspiration, Prophecy,
Heaven and Hell, Eternal punishment and a Day of
Judgment, Creeds, Liturgies, and Articles, the truth
of Jewish History and of Gospel narrative; a sense
of doubt thrown over even the Incarnation, the Resurrection,
and Ascension, the Divinity of the Second
Person, and the personality of the Third. It may be
that this is a <i>true</i> view of Christianity; but we insist,
in the name of common sense, that it is a <i>new</i> view.
Surely it is waste of time to argue that it is agreeable
to Scripture, and not contrary to the Canons<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xii" id="Preface_Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
This twofold phenomenon, which has shocked the
public conscience and perplexed common sense, has
been <i>the sole</i> cause of the amount of attention "Essays
and Reviews" has excited. Laymen might have combined
to produce this volume, almost unheeded. An
obscure Clergyman might possibly have published
any one of these seven papers; and with a rebuke for
his immorality or his insolence, he would probably
have been unnoticed by the world. But here is a
combination of Doctors of Divinity; Professors; Fel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xiii" id="Preface_Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>lows,
nay Heads of Colleges; Instructors of England's
Youth; Teachers of Religion; Chaplains to Royal
and noble personages!</p>

<p>The Jesuitical notice prefixed to the book, (deprecating
the idea that its authors should be held responsible,
except severally for their several articles,)
completed the scandal. As if seven men, each armed
with his own appropriate weapon of violence, breaking
into a house, and spreading ruin around them, could
"readily be understood," (to quote their own language,)
to incur each a limited responsibility!... Charity
doubtless would have rejoiced to spread her
mantle over any one or more of the number, "who,
on seeing the extravagantly vicious manner in which
some of his associates had performed their part, had
openly declared his disgust and abhorrence of such
unfaithfulness, and had withdrawn his name<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,"&mdash;with
some expression of sorrow for the irreparable mischief
which he had actively helped to occasion. But long
before <i>nine</i> editions of "Essays and Reviews" had
appeared, it became apparent that each of the living
authors, (for one, alas, has already gone to his account!)
has made himself responsible for the <i>whole</i>
work<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Nay, there are some of the number who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xiv" id="Preface_Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>make no secret of their satisfaction at what has happened;
and seem desirous only that their volume
should obtain a yet wider circulation<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>"Essays and Reviews," as already stated, with the
turn of the year, experienced a vast increase of notoriety.
The entire Bench of Bishops condemned the
book; and both Houses of Convocation endorsed the
Episcopal censure. A very careful perusal of the
volume became necessary; and it proved to be infinitely
weaker in point of ability, infinitely more
fatal in point of intention, than could have been suspected
from the known respectability and position of
its authors. A clamour also arose for a Reply to
these Seven Champions,&mdash;not exactly of Christendom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xv" id="Preface_Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>"You <i>condemn</i>: but why do you not <i>reply</i>?"&mdash;became
quite a popular form of reproach.</p>

<p>It was useless to urge, in private, such considerations
as the following:&mdash;To reply to a volume of 433
pages, each of which contains a fallacy or a falsity,&mdash;while
some pages are packed full of both,&mdash;is a serious
undertaking.&mdash;Besides, the book <i>has been</i> replied to
already; for there is scarcely an objection urged
within its pages which was not better urged, and
effectually disposed of, in the last century. Nay,
every good Review of "Essays and Reviews" has
<i>answered</i> the book: for what signify the details, if the
fundamental lie has been detected, and unrelentingly
exposed? The man who plants his heel on the serpent's
head, and refuses to withdraw it, can afford to
disregard the tortuous writhings of the long supple
body.&mdash;Again. These attacks are seven. Must seven
men <i>with</i> "concert and comparison,"&mdash;with leisure and
inclination too,&mdash;be procured to <i>demolish</i> this flimsy
compound of dogmatism and unbelief? to disperse
these cloudy doubts, and to analyse and repel these
many ambiguous statements?&mdash;Once more. A fool
can assert, and in a moment, that 'There is no <span class="smcap">God</span>.'
But it requires a wise man to refute the lie; and his
refutation will probably demand a volume.&mdash;I say,
it was in vain to urge such considerations as these.
"Why does no one <i>reply</i> to these 'Essays and Reviews?'"
was asked,&mdash;till, I apprehend, pens enough
have been unsheathed to do the work effectually.</p>

<p>It struck me, in the meantime, that I should be
employing myself not unprofitably at such a juncture,
if (laying aside all other work for a month or two)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xvi" id="Preface_Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>I were to attempt a short reply to the volume in question,
myself; and to combine it with the publication
of the Sermons I had already preached; and which
I had the comfort of learning had not only been
favourably received by some of those who heard them,
but had attracted some slight notice outside the
University also. Accordingly, with not a little reluctance,
in the month of February I began. The
<i>Destructive</i> part of the argument, I determined to address
to the younger members of my own College,&mdash;men
with whom I live in daily intimacy, and on
terms of private friendship; and whom, above all,
I desired to protect against the influence of that
"moral poison," (as the Bishop of Exeter describes
it,) of which the world has lately heard so much.
The <i>Constructive</i> part of the argument, I resolved to
complete as opportunities might offer, in my Sermons.
One such opportunity presented itself early in Lent;
of which I availed myself to establish some fundamental
truths relative to the Interpretation of Holy
Writ<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. By favour of the Vice Chancellor, the promise
of yet another preaching turn was obtained. It
appeared best to avail myself of the opportunity to
consider the chief objections which have been brought
against the Bible from the <i>marvellous</i> character of
some of its contents<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. An University Sermon preached
exactly ten years ago, (on the Doctrine of Accommodation,)
supplied an important link in the argument....
Thus the unscientific shape in which the present
volume appears, is explained; and its want of exact
method is accounted for. Let me add, that but for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xvii" id="Preface_Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>the forward state of what I like to regard as the
<i>Constructive</i> part of the present volume,&mdash;(and which
I am not without a humble hope will secure for the
rest a more than ephemeral interest,)&mdash;I should have
been slow indeed to undertake the distasteful task
of answering a work of which I have long since
been heartily weary.</p>

<p>II. And now, for a few words on the general question
which has called out these "Sermons" and "Preliminary
Remarks."</p>

<p>At the root of the whole mischief of these last days
lies <i>disbelief in the Bible</i> as <i>the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>. This
is the fundamental error. Dangerous enough is it
to the moral and intellectual nature of Man, when
the authority of the Church is doubted: or rather,
this is <i>the first</i> downward step. Not to believe that
Christ bequeathed to His Church a Divine form of
polity: not to believe that He set officers over His
Kingdom, of which He is Himself the sole invisible
Head: not to believe that He invested His Apostles
with authority to delegate to others the Commission
He had Himself conveyed to them; and that, by
virtue of such transmitted powers, the Church has
authority in the Ministration of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word and
Sacraments: not to believe that He vouchsafed to
His Church extraordinary guidance at the first, and
that He vouchsafes to His Church effectual guidance
still:&mdash;an utter want of faith in the Church and her
Ordinances, is the first step, I repeat, in a soul's
downward progress.</p>

<p>Next comes an impatience of Creeds. It has been
falsely asserted by an Essayist and Reviewer that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xviii" id="Preface_Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>"Constantine inaugurated the principle of doctrinal
limitation<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>;" by which is meant that definitions of
Faith date from the Council of Nic&aelig;a, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 325: the
truth being that the famous [OE]cumenical Council
which was then held did but rule the consubstantiality
of the <span class="smcap">Son</span> with the <span class="smcap">Father</span>: whereas elaborate Creeds
exist of a far earlier date; as all are aware. Creeds
indeed are coeval with Christianity itself<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. What
need to add that when the decree of the first [OE]cumenical
Council concerning the true faith in the adorable
Trinity has been set at nought, all other decisions of
the Church are disregarded also?</p>

<p>That marvellous concrete fact, the Bible,&mdash;has next
to be encountered. Unmethodical as it seems to be,
the Bible arrests a man in his impatient course with
many a significant History,&mdash;many an unmanageable
precept. Much of its contents, it is true, are of such
a nature that they may be glossed over,&mdash;explained
away,&mdash;ignored,&mdash;set aside. The reading is doubtful:
or there are two opinions, (perhaps twenty,) concerning
it: or the language may be figurative: or the
words are not to be pressed too closely: or a perverse
logic may pretend to find in it agreeable confirmation,
instead of stern reproof. Not a few places there are,
however, which defy any such handling; stubborn
rocks which refuse to yield a single trace of the
wished-for vegetation, in return for the most determined
husbandry. Nothing of the kind ever will or
can be made to germinate upon them. They are
absolutely unmanageable, and hopelessly in the way
of the man who is determined to cast off restraint,&mdash;whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xix" id="Preface_Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>spiritual, intellectual, or moral. He is for
being lawless; or at least, without law: but <i>the Bible</i>
is unmistakably <i>an external Law</i>, and is opposed to
him. The Bible is his enemy, and the Bible claims
to be Divine.... What need to state that to deny the
Inspiration of the Bible, and to undermine its authority,
and to explain away its statements, becomes the
next object of the unbeliever? It is precisely at this
stage of his downward progress that public attention
is excited, and public indignation aroused. The
Church, (like its Divine Author,) may be outraged,
and few will be found to remonstrate. The Creeds
may be assailed, (especially "one unhappy Creed!"),
and it is hinted that these are speculative matters, on
which none should pronounce too dogmatically. But
(thank <span class="smcap">God</span>!) Englishmen yet love their Bible; and
Common Sense is able to see that an uninspired Bible
is <i>no Bible at all</i>. At the assault upon the Bible,
therefore, as I said, an indignant outcry is raised,&mdash;as
<i>now</i>.</p>

<p>Systematically to cope with such irreverence, such
entire ignorance rather of all the questions at issue,
from the pulpit, would be clearly impracticable. Men
require to be taught "which be the first principles."
They require to be educated in Divinity. And thus
we come back to the fontal source of all the mischief
of our own Day. We, in Oxford, give no systematic
training to our Candidates for Holy Orders. We do
not even attempt it. Nay, incredible to relate, <i>we do
not give them any training at all</i>. And the fatal consequences
of this omission are to be seen on every
side. A youth no sooner gets through "the Schools,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xx" id="Preface_Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>and graduates in Arts, than he inquires for a Curacy.
During the three months, perhaps six, of interval, he
makes himself sufficiently acquainted with the Alphabet
of Divinity to enable him to satisfy the very
modest requirements of the Bishop's examination;
after which he finds himself at once actively engaged
in the Bishopric of souls and the profession of Theology.
It is probable that the realities of the Ministerial
calling, and the eminently practical nature of
such an one's daily life, will keep <i>this</i> man from error.
Not so his&mdash;more, shall I say, or less?&mdash;fortunate
fellow-student; who, by hard self-relying labour,
having obtained distinction in the Schools, finds himself
in the enjoyment of a fellowship, and straightway
engages in the work of tuition. This man, whose
fellowship is his "title" for orders, studies Divinity,
or neglects it, at pleasure: and if he studies it, he
studies it in his own way. He has read a little of
heathen Ethics with great care; or he has trained
himself to the exactness of mathematical inference.
With the purest idiom of ancient Greece he has also
made himself very familiar. He is besides a Master
of Arts. What need to add that such an one is not
therefore a Master of <i>Divinity</i>? possesses no qualification
which authorizes him to dogmatize about any
one department of <i>Theological Science</i>?</p>

<p>The plain truth is, (and it is really better to speak
plainly,)&mdash;the plain truth is, that the offensive Sermons
one sometimes hears from the University pulpit,&mdash;the
offensive Essays and Reviews which have lately
occasioned so much public scandal,&mdash;are the work of
men who discuss that which they do not understand;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxi" id="Preface_Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>profess that which they were never, at any time of
their life, taught. Their method of handling a text
is altogether unique and extraordinary. Their remarks
concerning Divine things are even puerile.
Their very citations of Scripture are incorrect. Their
cool affectation of superiority of knowledge, their claim
to intellectual power, would be laughable, were the
subject less solemn and important. Speculations so
feeble that they sound like the cries of an infant in
the dark, are insinuated to be the sublime views of
a bold and original thinker, who <i>"has by a Divine help
been enabled to plant his foot somewhere beyond the waves
of Time!"</i>&mdash;Doubts so badly expressed that they read
like the confused utterance of one in his sleep, claim
to be regarded as the legacy of one who is about to
<i>"depart hence before the natural term, worn out with
intellectual toil<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>!"</i> ... In a word,&mdash;Men who have
never been taught and trained, but have grown up in
a miserable self-evolved system of their own,&mdash;(with
a little of Hegel, and a little of Schleiermacher, and
a little of Strauss,)&mdash;cannot <i>but</i> trouble the peace of
the Church. They deny her authority. (They are
not aware of her claims.) They cavil at her Creeds.
(They are not acquainted with their history.) They
doubt the authenticity of the very Bible. (They know
wondrous little about it.)&mdash;How did the Bible attain
its actual shape? They cannot tell. How has it
been guarded? They are careless to inquire. How
does it come to us as 'the Bible,'&mdash;<i>the</i> Book of all
books? It is best not to discuss a question which
must infallibly bring forward <i>the Church</i> as "a witness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxii" id="Preface_Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>and a keeper of Holy Writ<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>." Men are even
impatient to publish their private prejudice that it is
to be interpreted like any other book; that it is inspired
in no other sense than Sophocles and Plato.
"The principle of private judgment," (it is said,)
"puts Conscience between us and the Bible, making
Conscience <i>the supreme interpreter<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></i>." "Hence," it is
said, "we use the Bible,&mdash;some consciously, some unconsciously,&mdash;not
to override, but to evoke the voice
of Conscience." (p.&nbsp;44.) "The Book of this Law,"
(as Hooker phrases it,) is dethroned; and Man usurps
the vacant seat, and becomes a Law unto himself!
<span class="smcap">God</span> Himself is dethroned, in effect; and Man becomes
his own god.</p>

<p>To cope systematically with all this from the University
pulpit, as already remarked, is plainly impossible.
The preacher must take up the question at
some definite stage, and arrest the false teachers <i>there</i>.
"That wicked,"&mdash;or rather "<span class="smcap">the lawless one</span>,"
(&#8001; &#7940;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#962;, as he is called in 2 Thess. ii. 8,)&mdash;must be
bound, hand and foot, <i>somewhere</i> in his career of lawlessness;
and in these Sermons <i>the threshold of the
Bible</i> has been chosen as the place for the conflict.
My life for his life. I will slay or be slain on the
very portal of Holy Scripture. With the young, you
begin at the beginning,&mdash;"the Creed, the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
Prayer, the Ten Commandments;" and they must be
further instructed in the Church Catechism. But the
foundation cannot be laid afresh with the full-grown.
It is idle to talk about the authority of <i>the Church</i> to
men who do not believe in the Bible. It is useless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxiii" id="Preface_Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>to dispute about Creeds with men who know nothing
of the origin and history of Christianity. Reserving
the <i>true</i> method of teaching for those who alone are
capable of being taught, we are constrained to argue
with men of full age about <i>the Inspiration and Interpretation
of the Bible</i>.&mdash;If in the ensuing Sermons the
principles handled are so very elementary, it is because
the available limits were so very narrow,&mdash;while the
field over which Unbelief has spread itself, is so
very broad.</p>

<p>III. When a few words have been added concerning
the manner in which I have executed my task,
this Preface shall be brought to a close.&mdash;If the style
of the present <span class="smcap">Sermons</span>,&mdash;considering the auditory,
and above all considering the subject,&mdash;shall be
thought by competent judges not sufficiently dignified
in parts, I will bow to their decision without remonstrance.
Everybody can divine the defence which
would be set up; but perhaps it may not be quite
a valid defence. A man feels strongly and warmly;
writes fast and freely; is determined to be clearly
understood: is weary of the dignified conventionalities
under which Scepticism loves to conceal itself when it
comes abroad. Perhaps some expressions which may
be permitted in delivery, ought to be remodelled when
a Sermon is sent to the press.</p>

<p>But with regard to the ensuing <span class="smcap">Preliminary remarks</span>,
I shall not so easily be persuaded to think
that I am mistaken as to the style in which Essayists
and Reviewers are to be dealt with<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Some respectable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxiv" id="Preface_Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>persons, I doubt not, will think my treatment of
them harsh and uncharitable. I invite them to consider
that we do not expect blasphemy from Ministers
of the Gospel,&mdash;irreligion from the teachers of youth,&mdash;infidelity
from the Professor's chair: nor are we
called upon to tolerate it either. I have the misfortune
to concur entirely with the verdict pronounced
by the Bishop of Exeter on the subject of 'Essays
and Reviews.' Let those who feel little jealousy for
<span class="smcap">God's</span> honour measure out in grains their censure of a
volume, the confessed tendency of which is to sap the
foundation of Faith, and to introduce irreligion with
a flood-tide. Such shall not, at all events, be <i>my</i>
method. Private regard, if it is to weigh largely with
him who stands up for <span class="smcap">God's</span> Truth, should first have
weighed a little with those by whom it has been most
grievously outraged. It may suit these Authors to
wrap up their shameful meaning in a cloud of words;
but their Reviewer avails himself of that Christian
liberty to which they themselves so systematically lay
claim, mercilessly to uncover their baseness, and uncompromisingly
to denounce it. If I may declare my
mind freely, punctilious courtesy in dealing with such
opinions, becomes a species of treason against Him
after whose Name we are called, and whom we profess
to serve. Seven men may combine to handle the
things of <span class="smcap">God</span>, it seems, in the most outrageous manner;
while <i>themselves</i> are to be the objects of consideration,
tenderness, respect! I cannot see their
title to any consideration at all.</p>

<p>It will be found, it is hoped, that when these writers
have the courage to descend to argument, <i>there</i> I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxv" id="Preface_Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>gladly met them on their own ground, and sought to
refute them: but <i>to reason</i> is no part of their plan.
Unsupported dicta on every subject on which they
treat: doubts promiscuously insinuated, but never
once openly and honestly maintained: cool assumptions
of intellectual superiority for themselves and
their infidel allies: contemptuous allusions to the
names which the respectable part of mankind agrees
to hold in honour: foul imputations against the
honesty of the Clergy:&mdash;<i>this</i> is all their method! The
favourite <i>cant</i> of these writers is, that no one should
shrink from free discussion, or fear the results of
Criticism. Why then do not they themselves criticize?
Why do not <i>they</i> reason? Charity herself
after weighing these Essays carefully has no alternative
but to assume that the Authors either have not
the courage, or that they lack the ability, to descend
to a free discussion, and risk all on a stand-up fight.
A kind of guerilla warfare: half a dozen arrows, and
a hasty retreat: <i>such</i> is their mode of attack! But
this method, though it may occasion annoyance, is
quite unworthy of an honest inquirer, and never can
be decisive of anything. It is the cowardly expedient
of men who shrink from scrutiny, and dread exposure.
Nothing so easy, for example, as to repeat the old
commonplace about "irreconcileable discrepancies" in
the "Synoptical Gospels:" but why, instead, are we
not told, <i>which these irreconcileable discrepancies are</i>?
For my own part, I freely renew in this place the
challenge I gave in my IIIrd Sermon<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Let any one
of these Gentlemen publicly and definitely lay his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxvi" id="Preface_Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>finger on one or more of these contradictory statements
in the Gospels, during term-time; and within
a week I hereby undertake publicly to refute him in
the Divinity School of this University: and our peers
shall be our judges.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who come abroad in the fashion above
described, have no right to complain if they encounter
rough usage on the road. When Critics are clamorous
for the "free handling" of Divine Truth, they must
not be surprised to find themselves freely handled too.
If free discussion is to be the order of the day, then
let there be free discussion of "Essays and Reviews,"
<i>as well as of</i> <span class="smcap">the Bible</span>. Six Clergymen of the Church
of England who enter upon a crusade against the Faith
of the Church of England must not be astonished if
they are looked upon in the light of immoral characters,
and treated as such. Accordingly, I have
handled <i>them</i> just as freely as <i>they</i> have handled the
Prophets, Apostles, and Evangelists of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>

<p>I cannot therefore pretend to offer anything in extenuation
of the style in which I have examined the
statements of these Essayists and Reviewers. Perfectly
sensible as I am of the gracefulness of highly
courteous language in controversial writing, I will not
so far violate my own conviction of what is right as to
bandy compliments on such an occasion as <i>this</i>. This
is no literary misunderstanding, or I could have been
amicable enough: no private or personal matter, or
I could have flung it from me with unconcern. No
other than an attempt to destroy Man's dearest hopes,
is this infamous book: no other than an insult, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxvii" id="Preface_Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>grossest imaginable, offered to the Majesty of Heaven;
an attack, the more foul because it is so insidious,
against the Everlasting Gospel of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>. In
such a cause I will <i>not</i> so far give in to the smooth
fashion of a supple and indifferent age, as to pay these
seven writers a single compliment which they will
care to accept. The most foolish composition of the
seven is Dr. Temple's; the most mischievous is Professor
Jowett's: but the germ of the last Essay is contained
in the first; the foolishness of the first Essay is
abundantly shared by the last: while the evidence of
correspondence of sentiment between the two writers
is unmistakable. The most unphilosophical Essay,
(where <i>all</i> are unphilosophical,) is Professor Powell's:
the most insolent, Dr. Williams': the most immoral,
Mr. Wilson's: the most shallow, Mr. Goodwin's; the
most irrelevant, Mr. Pattison's. Not one of these
writers shews himself capable of recognizing the true
logical result of his own opinions: of drawing from
his own premisses their one inevitable issue. Not one
of them has had the manliness to <i>speak out</i>, and to <i>say
plainly</i> what he means. They seem to deny the
Divinity of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and the Personality of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>: but how reluctant is a reader to believe that
they really <i>mean</i> it! Quite inevitable is it that these
clerical critics must choose between two alternatives.
Either they hold opinions which make it impossible
that they should retain Orders in the Church of England,
and yet be honest men; or they have expressed
themselves with such culpable inaccuracy and ambiguity,
as shews that they are altogether incompetent
to handle the Science of Theology.&mdash;Gladly would one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxviii" id="Preface_Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>give them the benefit of a third alternative: but I
see not that any remains.</p>

<p>If it should be thought strange that one thinking
so meanly of 'Essays and Reviews' should have produced
a yet larger volume in reply to them, it must
suffice to point out that the refutation of a fallacy
is almost of necessity the ampler writing.&mdash;Or again,
if it be remarked that by far the largest part of what
I have written is directed against the hundred pages
of Professor Jowett, the explanation is still obvious.
For not only does that concluding Essay of his bring
to a terribly practical issue the speculative doubts and
difficulties which had been started by all his predecessors;
(namely, doubts as to (1)&nbsp;the relation in
which the Bible stands to Man;&mdash;(2)&nbsp;the nature
of Prophecy;&mdash;(3)&nbsp;the reality of Miracles;&mdash;(4)&nbsp;the
worth of Creeds and formularies;&mdash;(5)&nbsp;the authenticity
of Genesis;&mdash;(6)&nbsp;the basis on which Revelation is
by the Church of England supposed to rest;)&mdash;by
proposing that we should henceforth regard the Bible
as a book <i>no otherwise inspired than Sophocles and Plato</i>:&mdash;not
only does Professor Jowett's essay discharge
this fatal office; but his style is somewhat peculiar;
and what he says, cannot always be effectually disposed
of by a few words. Let me explain.</p>

<p>There is a certain form of fallacy of statement in
which this Gentleman's writings abound, which calls
aloud for notice and signal reprobation. He has a
marvellous aptitude, (one would fain hope through
some intellectual infirmity,) of connecting together in
the same sentence two or three clauses; one or two
of which shall be true as Heaven, while the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxix" id="Preface_Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>is false as Hell. The reply to such a sentence is impossible,
without many words,&mdash;far more than Mr.
Jowett's sentences commonly deserve.&mdash;Sometimes he
strings together several heads of thought; of which
enumeration the kindest thing which can be said is
that it betrays an utter want of intellectual perspective.
To unravel even a part of this tangled web so as to
expose its argumentative worthlessness, soon fills a
page.... But there is another kind of fallacy which
the same gentleman wields with immense effect, and
in the use of which he is a great master; which,
because it was absolutely impossible to handle it fitly
in the proper place, shall be briefly adverted to, here.
I proceed to describe it not without indignation; for
I am profoundly struck by the intellectual perversity,
not to say the moral obliquity, which has so entirely
made this vile instrument its own.</p>

<p>The fallacy then is of this nature. When Professor
Jowett would put forth something especially
deserving of reprehension,&mdash;some sentiment or opinion
which he either knows, or ought to know, that the
whole Church will resent with unqualified abhorrence,&mdash;he
assumes a plaintive manner, and puts himself
into an interesting attitude; sometimes even folds his
hands, as if in prayer. He then begins by (1)&nbsp;throwing
out a remark of real beauty, and so conciliating for
himself an indulgent hearing; or (2)&nbsp;he goes off on
some Moral question, and so defeats attention; or (3)&nbsp;he
delivers himself of some undeniable truth, and so
disarms censure; or (4)&nbsp;he says something of an entirely
equivocal kind, and so leaves his reader at fault.
Candour, of course, gives him the benefit of the doubt.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Preface_Page_xxx" id="Preface_Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>It is not till the sentence is well advanced, or till it is
examined by the fatal light of its context, that one is
shewn what the ambiguous writer really was intending.
A cloven foot appears at last; but it is instantly
withdrawn, with a shuffle; and you experience a
scowl or a sneer, as the case may be, for your extreme
unkindness in inquiring whether it was not a cloven
foot you saw?... Meanwhile, the learned Professor
has gone off <i>in alia omnia</i>, with a look of earnestness
which challenges respect, and a vagueness of diction
which at once discourages pursuit and defeats inquiry.
The fish invariably ends by disappearing in a cloud
of his own ink.</p>

<p>It shall suffice to have said thus much. These
pages must now be suffered to go forth; not without
a hearty aspiration that a blessing may attend them
from Him <i>sine Quo nihil est validum, nihil sanctum</i>;
and that what was intended for the strength and help
of those who want helping and strengthening, (I am
thinking particularly of what has been offered on the
subject of Inspiration,) may not prove misleading or
perplexing to any.</p>

true is what follows:&mdash;"The Bible is one; and it is too late now
to propose to divide it. We shall only point out that the <i>moral
value of the Gospel teaching becomes suspicious</i> when the whole
miraculous element is discarded.
</p><p>
"We certainly do think that the Gospels assert a miraculous
Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension; and that the Epistles
teach Original Sin, and a vicarious Sacrifice. If this be doubted
by our authors, it is sufficient for us to say that such is the impression
they have created on all ages of Christians."
</p><p>
"We desire that if the Bible, or any part of it be retained as
Holy Writ, it be defended as a miraculous gift to Man, and not
by distorting the principles of modern Science. Let the Essayists
be assured that there exists <i>no middle course</i>; that there is no
Inspiration more than is natural, yet not supernatural; <i>no Theology
which can abandon its doctrines and retain its authority</i>."
</p><p>
Lastly, with what sickening and almost Satanic power, does the
same writer invite the Essayists and Reviewers to make shipwreck
of their souls in the following terrible passage. And yet, who sees
not that <i>on their principles</i> absolute and professed unbelief is <i>inevitable</i>?
He says:&mdash;"How long shall this last? Until men have
the courage to bury their dead convictions out of sight, and the
greater courage to form new. All honour to these writers for the
boldness with which they have, at great risk, urged their opinions.
<i>But what is wanted is strength</i> not merely to face the world, but
<i>to face one's own conclusions</i>. We know the cost. It must be
endured. Let each who has thought and felt for himself, ask himself
first what he <i>does not</i> believe, and then, if wise or needful,
avow it. Next let him ask himself what he <i>does</i> believe, and
pursue it to its true and full conclusions. Neither loose accommodation
nor sonorous principles will long give them rest. It is of
as little use to surrender the more glaring contradictions of Science
as it is to evaporate discredited doctrine into a few vague precepts.
That end will not be attained by our authors by subliming Religion
into an emotion, and making an armistice with Science. It will
not be obtained by any unreal adaptation; <i>nor by this, which is,
of all recent adaptations</i>, at once the most able, the most earnest,
and <i>the most suicidal</i>."</p></div>

"I have not yet discovered any community or individual possessing

this strife; but the course of events, when I first took
up my pen, left me almost without an alternative.
Far more reluctant should I be to seem to make yourselves
the arbiters of Theological controversy. But in
truth nothing is further from my present intention.
As a plain matter of fact, you are called upon weekly,
at St. Mary's, to listen to Sermons which indicate
plainly enough the troubled state of the religious
atmosphere; and which, of late, (too frequently alas!)
have inevitably assumed a controversial aspect. The
Sermons here published, (which form the constructive
part of the present volume,) were preached expressly
with an eye to <i>your</i> advantage, and were intended
to warn you against (what I deemed) a very serious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>danger. It is only natural therefore that I should desire
to address to yourselves the present remarks likewise.
<i>You</i> are, naturally, objects of special solicitude
to myself in this place,&mdash;you, with whom I live as
among friends, and for not a few of whom I entertain
a sincere affection. And in addressing you, I am not
by any means inviting you to exercise your own theological
judgment; for <i>that</i> would indeed be an absurd
proceeding. I am simply seeking to instruct you, and
to guide you with mine.</p>

<p>The case of "Essays and Reviews" is, in fact,
altogether exceptional,&mdash;whether the respectability of
its authors, the wickedness of its contents, or the
reception which it has met with, is considered. That
volume embodies the infidel spirit of the present day.
Turn where you will, you encounter some criticism
upon it. No advertizing column but contains repeated
mention of its name. To ignore so flagrant a scandal
to the Church, is quite impossible. I have thought
it better, therefore, to encounter the danger in this
straightforward way; and I proceed, without further
preamble, to remark briefly on each of the Seven
"Essays and Reviews," in order.</p>

<p>I. The feeblest essay in the volume is the first. It is
not without grave concern that I transcribe the name
of its amiable, and (in every relation of private life)
truly excellent author,&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Frederick Temple, D.D.</span>,
Chaplain in Ordinary to the Queen; Head Master of
Rugby School; Chaplain to the Earl of Denbigh."
Under the imposing title of "<span class="smcap">The Education of the
World</span>," we are presented with a worthless allegory,
which has all the faults of a schoolboy's theme, (incorrect
grammar included;) and not one of the excellencies
which ought to characterize the product of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>a ripened understanding,&mdash;the work of a Doctor of
Divinity in the English Church<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Temple's opening speculations are at once unintelligible,
irrelevant, and untrue. But they are
immaterial; and serve only to lug in, (not to introduce,)
the assumption that the "power, whereby the
present ever gathers into itself the results of the past,
transforms the human race into a colossal man whose
life reaches from the Creation to the day of Judgment.
The successive generations of men are days
in this man's life. The discoveries and inventions
which characterize the different epochs of the world's
history are his works. The creeds and doctrines, the
opinions and principles of the successive ages, are his
thoughts." [Alas, that the Creeds and Doctrines
of the Church should be spoken of by a Professor
of Divinity as the "thoughts" of men!] "The state
of society at different times are (<i>sic</i>) his manners.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>He grows in knowledge, in self-control, in visible
size, just as we do. And his education is in the same
way and for the same reason precisely similar to ours.
All this is no figure, but only a compendious statement
of a very comprehensive fact." (p.&nbsp;3.) "We
may then," (he repeats,) "rightly speak of a childhood,
a youth, and a manhood of the world." (p.&nbsp;4.) And the
process of this development of the colossal man, "corresponds,
stage by stage, with the process by which
the infant is trained for youth, and the youth for
manhood. This training has three stages. In childhood,
we are subject to positive rules which we cannot
understand, but are bound implicitly to obey. In
youth we are subject to the influence of example, and
soon break loose from all rules, unless illustrated and
enforced by the higher teaching which example imparts.
In manhood we are comparatively free from
external restraints, and if we are to learn, must be our
own instructors. First comes the Law, then the Son
of Man, then the Gift of the Spirit. The world was
once a child under tutors and governors until the time
appointed by the Father. Then, when the fit season
had arrived, the Example to which all ages should
turn was sent to teach men what they ought to be.
Then the human race was left to itself, to be guided
by the teaching of the Spirit within." (p.&nbsp;5.)&mdash;So very
weak an analogy, (where everything is assumed, and
nothing proved,) singular to relate, is drawn out into
distressing tenuity through no less than 49 pages.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Answer</span> to all this is sufficiently obvious, as
well as sufficiently damaging; and need not be delayed
for a minute.</p>

<p>That the Human Race has made considerable progress
in Knowledge, from first to last,&mdash;is a mere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>truism. That, in the civilized world, one generation
is the heir of the generations which went before it, is
what no one requires to be told. Thus the discovery
of the compass, of printing, and of the steam-engine,
have been epochs in human knowledge from which
a start was made by all civilized nations, without retrogression.
But such facts supply no warrant for
transforming the whole Human Race into one Colossal
Man; do not constitute any reason whatever why the
6000 years of recorded time should be divided into
three periods corresponding with the Infancy, Boyhood,
and Manhood of an Individual.</p>

<p>To this theory, however, Dr. Temple even ostentatiously
commits himself. It is the purpose of his
entire Essay, to establish the fanciful analogy already
indicated,&mdash;which is proclaimed to be "no figure" but
a "fact." (p.&nbsp;3.) But an educated man of ordinary
intelligence, on reaching p.&nbsp;7, (where the writer first
discloses his view,) summons the known facts of History
to his recollection; and before he proceeds any
further, reasons with himself somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Human Race had inhabited the Earth's surface
for upwards of sixteen hundred years, when it was
destroyed by the waters of the Flood. After that,
the descendants of Noah peopled the earth's surface;
a transaction of which the sole authentic record is to
be found in the xth chapter of the Book of Genesis.
Egypt first emerged into importance,&mdash;as history and
monuments conspire to prove; having had a peculiar
language and literature, Arts and Sciences, anterior to
the period of the Exodus, viz. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1491. Meanwhile,
the chart of History directs our attention to four great
Empires: the Assyrian Empire, which was swallowed
up by the Persian; and the Persian, which was merged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>in the Grecian Empire. The Roman Empire came last.
[How <i>Law</i> can be considered to be the characteristic
of all or any part of this period, I am at a loss to
discover. Neither do I see any indication of puling
Infancy here.] These four great Empires of the world
had run their course when our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span>
was born. <span class="smcap">God</span> sent His own Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span> into
the world; and lo, a change passed over the whole
fabric of the world's polity. The old forms of social
life became, as it were, dissolved; or rather, a new
spirit had been breathed into them all. A new era
had commenced; and a new principle henceforth
animated mankind. That peculiar system of Divine
Laws which for 1500 years had separated the Hebrew
race from all the nations of the earth,&mdash;the Mosaic
Law which had hitherto been the inheritance of a
single family, isolated in Canaan,&mdash;was explained and
expanded by its Divine Author. The ancient promises
to Abraham and his posterity were declared in
their application to be co-extensive with the whole race
of Mankind by faith embracing them. Henceforth,
the kingdoms of the world were proclaimed the kingdoms
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and <i>Mankind became for the first time
subject to a written Law</i>. The Laws of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> Kingdom,
the doctrines of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> Church, henceforth become
supreme. Thus, when a Christian Sovereign is
crowned, the Bible is solemnly placed in his hands;
and it is required of him that he promise, on his oath,
"to the utmost of his power, <i>to maintain the Laws of
<span class="smcap">God</span></i>." "When you see this Orb set under this Cross,"
(says the Archbishop, on delivering those insignia of
Royalty,) "remember that the whole World is subject
to the power and empire of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> our Redeemer ...
so that no man can reign happily, who ... directs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>not all his actions <i>according to His Laws</i>." ... No
further change in the order of things is anywhere intimated.
The Faith hath been &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;,&mdash;once and for
ever,&mdash;delivered to the Saints. Forsaken, it may be:
by many, (alas!) <i>it will be</i> forsaken before the consummation
of all things: but it will not itself cease.
Heaven and Earth shall pass away; but <span class="smcap">Christ's</span>
Word, never. Not one jot nor one tittle of <i>the Law</i>
shall fail.... Such, in brief outline, is the World's
true history,&mdash;past, present, future. Does it correspond
with Dr. Temple's account? That may be
very soon seen. He calls the human race a Colossal
Man; and says that it passes through three stages,&mdash;Infancy,
Boyhood, Manhood: and that during those
three stages, it is governed by three corresponding
principles,&mdash;Law, Example, Conscience. How does
Dr. Temple establish the first?</p>

<p>The Jews, (he says,) were subject to Law from the
period of the Exode to the coming of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&mdash;We
listen to the statement of a familiar fact without surprise:
but we are inclined to express some stronger
feeling than surprise when we discover that this is <i>the
whole</i> of the proof concerning the infancy of the Colossal
Man! Does this writer then mean to tell us that the
Jews were all Mankind? If they were <i>not</i> the Colossal
Man,&mdash;if, instead of being the whole Human Race,
they were one of the most inconsiderable and least
known of the nations,&mdash;an isolated family, in fact, inhabiting
Canaan,&mdash;what becomes of the analogy? We
really pause for an answer.... Such a theory might
have been expected, and would have been excusable
if it had proceeded from a Sunday-school-boy of fifteen,&mdash;who
had read the Bible indeed, but who was unacquainted
with any book besides; and so, had jumped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>to the conclusion that the Jews were "the World."
But Dr. Temple is a Schoolmaster, and therefore must
surely know better. If he is fanciful enough to regard
Mankind as a Colossal Man; and unphilosophical
enough to consider that History is capable of
being divided into three periods,&mdash;corresponding with
Infancy, Boyhood, and Manhood; and forgetful enough
of the facts of the case to assume that mankind was subject
to Law <i>until</i> the coming of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, thenceforward
to be emancipated therefrom:&mdash;yet Dr. Temple ought
not to be so unreasonable as to pretend that Canaan
was coextensive with the World,&mdash;the descendants of
Abraham with the posterity of Noah! This amiable
writer is inexcusable for excluding from the corporate
entity of the Human Race the four great Empires of
the world, (to say nothing of prim&aelig;val Egypt and
mysterious India;) and for the sake of elaborating
a worthless allegory, identifying the least of all people
with the Colossal Man, who, (according to his own
account of the matter,) represents the aggregate of
all the nations.</p>

<p>Once more. The Mosaic Law was not given till
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1491. But the world was then upwards of 2500
years old. Far more than one-third, therefore, of recorded
time had already elapsed. How does it happen
that the theory under consideration gives no account
of those 2500 years; or rather, does not begin to be
applicable, until they have rolled away?</p>

<p>Other inconveniences await this silly speculation.
Thus, the Colossal Man, (who was <i>under Law</i> from
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1491 to the Christian &aelig;ra,) proves to have been
a marvellously precocious Infant. He wrote the Song
of Moses <i>in the year of his birth</i>. Nay, he built pyramids,&mdash;had
a Literature, Arts, and Sciences,&mdash;<i>ages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>before he was born!...</i> While yet an infant, he sang
with Homer, and carved with Phidias, and philosophized
with Aristotle,&mdash;as none have ever sung, or
carved, or philosophized since. Times and fashions
have altered, truly; but these three men are still <i>our</i>
Masters in Philosophy, in Sculpture, and in Song.
Awkward fact, that the colossal Infant should have
lisped in a tongue which for copiousness of diction,
and subtlety of expression, absolutely remains to this
hour without a rival in the world!</p>

<p>Again. At this writer's dogmatic bidding, we force
ourselves to think of Mankind as a Colossal Man, who
has already gone through three ages,&mdash;Infancy, Boyhood,
and Manhood. <i>Old Age is therefore to come next</i>.
When, (if it is a fair question,) may it be expected
that the sad period of senile decrepitude will set in?
What proof, in the mean time, is there, (we venture
to ask,) that this period of decay has not begun
already? Or does Dr. Temple perhaps imagine that
the world is moving in cycles, (to adopt the grotesque
speculation of his own first pages); and that after
having run through the curriculum of Infancy, Boyhood,
and Manhood, the Colossal Man, (escaping, for
some unexplained reason, the penalty of Old Age,)
is to grow young again,&mdash;shake his rattle and cut
his teeth afresh? There is a childish vivaciousness,
a juvenile recklessness, a skittish impatience of restraint,
in this amiable author's speculations, which
powerfully corroborate such a view of the case.</p>

<p>"The Childhood of the World was over when our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared on earth," (p.&nbsp;20.) says Dr. Temple.
But when at last he is compelled to introduce to our
notice his Colossal Child (p.&nbsp;9, <i>bottom</i>.) now developed
into a Colossal Youth, he is painfully sensible that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>Law and the Prophets, (his schoolmasters,) (p.&nbsp;8.) have
not done their work quite so well as was to have been
desired and expected. Some apology is necessary,
(p.&nbsp;13, <i>bottom</i>.) Two great results however he claims
for their discipline:&mdash;"a settled national belief in the
unity and spirituality of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and an acknowledgement
of the paramount importance of chastity as a
point of morals." (p.&nbsp;11.) Not however that the Law
or the Prophets had taught them even <i>this</i>. (p.&nbsp;10,
<i>top</i>.) "It was in the Captivity, far from the temple
and the sacrifices of the temple, that the Jewish people
first learned that the spiritual part of worship could
be separated from the ceremonial; and that of the two
the spiritual was far the higher." (p.&nbsp;10.) At Babylon
also the Jews first distinctly learned the doctrine
of the immortality of the soul. (p.&nbsp;19.)&mdash;The Law, to
be sure, had emphatically said,&mdash;"Hear, O Israel, the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy <span class="smcap">God</span> is <i>one <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></i>." The prophets, to be
sure, had protested,&mdash;"Behold, to obey is better than
sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>." The Law and the Prophets, to be sure,
are full of intimations that "mercy and not sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>"
is acceptable to the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Heaven, and that <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Saints well understood the Doctrine<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; as well as that
a belief in the soul's immortality was a part of the
instruction of the Jewish people. But what is all this
to one who has an allegory to establish?...</p>

<p><i>The facts</i> of the case, in the meantime, sorely perplex
the truth-loving writer. "For it is undeniable
that, in the time of our Lord, the Sadducees had lost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>all depth of spiritual feeling, whilst the Pharisees had
succeeded in converting the Mosaic system into a
mischievous idolatry of forms." (p.&nbsp;10.) "In short,
the Jewish nation had lost very much when John the
Baptist came." (p.&nbsp;11.) The hopelessly corrupt moral
state of the youthful Colossus, described with such
sickening force and power by the great Apostle in the
first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, cannot
have occurred to Dr. Temple's remembrance, for he
says nothing about it. Certain withering denunciations
of "a wicked and adulterous generation<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>;"&mdash;of
"adulterers and adulteresses<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>;"&mdash;"serpents," a
"generation of vipers," which should hardly "escape
the damnation of Hell<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>;"&mdash;ought to have reached him
with a reproachful echo; but he is silent about them
all. Still less would it have suited the amiable allegorizer
to state that <i>just midway</i> in the educational
process, his Colossal Youth, "as if" the sins of Samaria
and of Sodom "were a very little thing," "<i>was corrupted
more than they in all his ways</i>. As I live, saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>," (apostrophizing Dr. Temple's Colossal
Youth, in allusion to his character and conduct in the
middle of his infant career,) "<i>Sodom</i> thy sister <i>hath not
done as thou</i> hast done: ... <i>neither hath Samaria committed
half thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations
more than they</i>.... Bear thine own shame
for thy sins that thou hast committed <i>more abominable
than they</i>. They are more righteous than thou<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>!"
"Ah sinful nation, laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers,
children that are corrupters!... From the sole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>of the foot even unto the head,"&mdash;[these words, remember,
are addressed to the Colossal Infant just <i>midway</i>
in his career; and Heaven and Earth are called
upon to give ear, "for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken!" ...
From the sole to the crown,] "there is no soundness
in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores....
Your hands are full of blood<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>!" ... About all this
hideous retrospect of what was going on at school,
Dr. Temple is silent.</p>

<p>In like manner, the great fact that our <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>
came to republish His own two prim&aelig;val ordinances,&mdash;the
spiritual observance of the Sabbath and the
sanctity of Marriage,&mdash;is quietly ignored. A youth
utterly degraded by sensuality<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, and blinded by unbelief<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>,
is a terrible picture truly. Dr. Temple therefore
boldly gives the lie direct to History, sacred and
profane; and insists that "side by side with freedom
from idolatry, <i>there had grown up in the Jewish mind
a chaster morality than was to be found elsewhere in the
world</i>:" (p.&nbsp;12:) that "<i>in chastity the Hebrews stood
alone</i>; and this virtue, which had grown up with
them from their earliest days&nbsp;(!!!) <i>was still in the
vigour of fresh life when they were commissioned to give
the Gospel to the nations</i>." (p.&nbsp;13.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Behold the Colossal Child therefore, now grown
into a Colossal "Youth too old for discipline." (p.
20, <i>bottom</i>.) "The tutors and governors have done
their work;" (p.&nbsp;20;) and he is now to go through
a distinct process of training. Three tutors are now
brought in to give the finishing touches to the youth's
education, and to inaugurate his new career. Rome,
Greece, and Asia,&mdash;which for some unexplained reason
never become (according to Dr. Temple) any part of
the Colossal Man <i>at all</i>,&mdash;now come in; "Rome to
discipline the human will; Greece, the reason and
taste; Asia, the spiritual imagination." (p.&nbsp;19.) The
Law and the Prophets had disciplined the Colossal
Child's conscience,&mdash;with what success we have seen.
At all events, Moses and Isaiah are for infants: we
have passed the age for such helps as <i>they</i> could
supply. In a word,&mdash;"The childhood of the world
was over when our Lord appeared on earth." (p.&nbsp;20.)
It was "just the meeting-point of the Child and the
Man; the brief interval which separates restraint
from liberty." (p.&nbsp;22.) "It was time that the second
teacher of the Human Race should begin his labours.
The second teacher is <span class="smcap">Example</span>:" (p.&nbsp;20:) and "the
period of youth in the history of the world, when the
human race was, as it were, put under the teaching
of example, corresponds, of course, to the meeting
point of the Law and the Gospel. The second stage
therefore in the education of man was the presence
of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> upon earth." (p.&nbsp;24.)</p>

<p>Let not this stage of Dr. Temple's allegory suffer
by being stated in any language besides his own.
"The world" had been a Colossal Child for 1490
years. It was to be a Youth for almost 100. "The
whole period from the closing of the Old Testament
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>to the close of the New was the period of the world's
youth,&mdash;the age of examples: and our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> presence
was not the only influence of that kind which has
acted upon the human race. Three companions were
appointed by Providence to give their society to this
creature whom <span class="smcap">God</span> was educating, Greece, Rome, and
the Early Church." (p.&nbsp;26.) Behold then, our Blessed
Redeemer with His "three companions." (I reproduce
this blasphemous speculation with shame and
sorrow.) What kind of Example <i>He</i> was, Dr. Temple
omits to inform us. But Greece was "the brilliant
social companion;"&mdash;Rome, "the bold and clever
leader;"&mdash;the Early Church was "the earnest, heavenly-minded
friend." (p.&nbsp;26.) We are warned therefore
against supposing that "our Lord's presence was
<i>the only influence of that kind</i>," (i.e. example,) appointed
by Providence for the creature whom God was educating.
In a word: "The world was now grown old
enough to be taught by seeing the lives of Saints,
<i>better than by hearing the words of Prophets</i>." (pp.
28-9.)</p>

<p>We come now to the conclusion of the allegory;
and Dr. Temple shall again speak for himself. "The
age of reflection begins. From the storehouse of his
youthful experience the Man begins to draw the principles
of his life. The spirit or conscience comes to
full strength and assumes the throne intended for him
in the soul. As an accredited judge, invested with
full powers, he sits in the tribunal of our inner kingdom,
decides upon the past, and legislates upon the
future without appeal except to himself. He decides
not by what is beautiful, or noble, or soul-inspiring,
but by what is right. Gradually he frames his code
of laws, revising, adding, abrogating, as a wider and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>deeper experience gives him clearer light. He is the
third great teacher and the last." (p.&nbsp;31.)</p>

<p>And now, it will reasonably be asked,&mdash;May not
the head-master of Rugby write a weak and foolish
Essay on a subject which he evidently does not understand,
without incurring so much not only of public
ridicule, but of public obloquy also? If his own sixth-form
boys do not laugh at him, need the Church feel
aggrieved at what he has written? Where is the special
<i>irreligion</i> in all this?</p>

<p>I answer,&mdash;The offence is of the very gravest character;
and in the course of what follows, it will appear
with sufficient plainness wherein it consists. For
the moment,&mdash;singly considered,&mdash;it is my painful
duty to condemn Dr. Temple's Essay on the following
grounds.</p>

<p>Whereas the Church inculcates the paramount necessity
of <i>an external authoritative Law</i> to guide all
her members;&mdash;Creeds to define the foundation of
their Faith,&mdash;a Catechism to teach them the necessary
elements of Christian Doctrine,&mdash;the several forms of
Prayer contained in the Prayer Book to instruct them
further in Religion, as well as to prescribe their exact
mode of worshipping <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span>: whereas too
the Church requires of her ministers subscription to
Articles "for the avoiding of Diversities of Opinions,
and for the establishing of Consent concerning true
Religion;"&mdash;above all, since all Christian men alike
are taught to acknowledge the external guidance of
the Divine Law itself contained in Holy Scripture,&mdash;and
every Minister of the Church of England is further
called upon to admit the authority of that Divine
Law as it is by the Church systematized, explained, upheld,
enforced:&mdash;notwithstanding all this, Dr. Temple,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>who has solemnly taken the vows of a minister of
the Church of England, and writes after his name
that he is <i>Sacr&aelig; Theologi&aelig; Professor</i>, in his present
Essay more than insinuates, he openly teaches that
Man "draws <i>the principles of his life</i>," (not from Revelation,
but) "<i>from</i> the storehouse of <i>experience</i>:" that
we live in an age when "the spirit or conscience having
come to full strength, assumes the throne intended
for him in the soul." This "spirit or conscience"
"legislates <i>without appeal except to himself</i>." "He is
the third great teacher and the last." (p.&nbsp;31.) The
world, in the days of its youth, could not "walk by
reason and conscience alone:" (p.&nbsp;21:) but it is not
so with us, in these, the days of the world's manhood.
"The spiritual power within us ... must be the rightful
monarch of our lives." (p.&nbsp;14.) <i>We</i>, (he says,)
"walk by reason and conscience <i>alone</i>." (p.&nbsp;21.)</p>

<p>Now this is none other than a deliberate dethroning
of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and a setting up of Self in His place. "A
revelation speaking from without and not from within,
is an external Law, and not a spirit,"&mdash;(p.&nbsp;36,) says
Dr. Temple. But I answer,&mdash;A revelation speaking
from within, and not from without, is <i>no revelation at
all</i>. "The thought of building a tower high enough
to escape <span class="smcap">God</span>'s wrath, could enter into no man's
dreams," (p.&nbsp;7,) says Dr. Temple in the beginning of
his Essay, in derision of the Old World. But he has
carried out into act the very self-same thought, himself;
and his "dreams" occupy the foremost place
in 'Essays and Reviews.' He teaches, openly, that
henceforth Man must learn by "<i>obedience to the rules
of his own mind</i>." (p.&nbsp;34.) He is express in declaring
that "an external law" is for the age which is past,
(pp.&nbsp;34-5.) Ours is "an internal law;" "which bids
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>us yield,"&mdash;not to the revealed Will of <span class="smcap">God</span>, "but,&mdash;to
the majesty of truth and justice; <i>a law which is not
imposed upon us by another power, but by our own enlightened
will</i>." (p.&nbsp;35.) In this, the last stage of the
Colossal Man's progress, Dr. Temple gives him four
avenues of learning: (1)&nbsp;Experience, (2)&nbsp;Reflection,
(3)&nbsp;Mistakes, (4)&nbsp;Contradiction. By withholding from
this enumeration <i>the Revealed Will of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>, and <i>the
known sanctions of the Divine Law</i>, he <i>thrusts out <span class="smcap">God</span></i>
from every part of his scheme; denies that He is even
one of the present teachers of the Human Race,&mdash;explaining
that the time has even gone by when <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
could teach by example<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>,&mdash;"for the faculty of Faith
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>has turned inwards, and cannot now accent any outer
manifestations of the truth of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>." (p.&nbsp;24.)&mdash;By this
Essay, Dr. Temple comes forward as the open abettor
of the most boundless scepticism. Whether or no
his statements be such as Ecclesiastical Courts take
cognizance of, is to me a matter of profound unimportance.
In the estimation of the whole Church, it
can be entitled to but one sentence. "We use the
Bible," (he tells us,) "not to override, but to evoke
the voice of conscience." (p.&nbsp;44.) "The current is
all one way,&mdash;it evidently points to the identification
of the Bible with the voice of conscience. The Bible,
in fact, is hindered by its form from exercising a despotism&nbsp;(!) over the human spirit; if it could do that,
it would become an outer law at once." (p.&nbsp;45.) Even
if men "could appeal to a revelation from Heaven,
they would still be under the Law&nbsp;(!!!); for a Revelation
speaking from without, and not from within,
is an external Law, and not a Spirit." (p.&nbsp;36.) "The
principle of private judgment puts conscience between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>us and the Bible; making conscience the supreme interpreter,
whom it may be a duty to enlighten, but
whom it can never be a duty to disobey." (<i>Ibid.</i>)&mdash;Even
those who look upon the observance of Sunday
"as enjoined by an absolutely binding decree," are
reproached as "thus at once putting themselves under
a law." (p.&nbsp;44.) ... Dr. Temple has written an Essay
which he calls "an argument," and for which he
claims "a drift." (p.&nbsp;31.) <i>That</i> argument is neither
more nor less than a direct assault on the Faith of
Christian men; and carried out to its lawful results,
<i>can</i> lead to nothing but open Infidelity;&mdash;which makes
it a very solemn consideration that the author, (whose
private worth is known to all,) should be a teacher
of the youth of Christian England. <i>That</i> drift I deplore
and condemn; and no considerations of private
friendship, no sincere regard for the writer's private
worth, shall deter me from recording my deliberate
conviction that it is wholly incompatible with his
Ordination vows.</p>

<p>I forbear to dive into the depth of irreligion and
unbelief implied in what is contained from p.&nbsp;37 to
p.&nbsp;40, and other parts of the present Essay: but I
cannot abstain from asking why does this author,&mdash;who,
in all the intercourse of private life, is so manly
a character,&mdash;fall into the <i>un</i>manly trick of his brother-Essayists,
of insinuating what they dare not
openly avow? The great master of this cloudy shuffling
art is Mr. Jowett. Even where he and his associates
in "free handling," are express and definite in
their statements, yet, as their rule is prudently to abstain
from adducing a single example of their meaning,
it is only by their disingenuous reticence that they
escape punishment or exposure. Thus, Dr. Temple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>speaks of "many of the doctrinal statements of the
early Church" being "plainly unfitted for permanent
use;" (p.&nbsp;41;) but he prudently abstains from explaining
<i>which</i> of those "doctrinal statements" he
means. He goes on to remark:&mdash;"In fact, the
Church of the Fathers claimed to do what not even
the Apostles had claimed,&mdash;namely, not only to teach
the Truth, but to clothe it in logical statements ...
for all succeeding time." He is evidently alluding
to "the forms in which the first ages of the Church
defined the Truth;" [i.e. to the Creeds;] of which he
says, we "<i>yet refuse to be bound by them</i>." (p.&nbsp;44.)
He goes on,&mdash;"It belongs to a later epoch to see
'the law within the law' which absorbs such statements
<i>into something higher than themselves</i>." (p.&nbsp;41.)
But the writer of that sentence ought to have had
the manliness to explain <i>what</i> that "higher something" <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Temple's estimate of the corruptions of the
Papacy is of a piece with the rest of what I must be
excused for calling a most unworthy performance.
"Purgatory," &amp;c. (he says) "was in fact, neither
more nor less than <i>the old schoolmaster come back</i> to
bring some new scholars to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>." (p.&nbsp;42.) (Is
the Romish fable of Purgatory then to be put on the
same footing as the Divine Revelation to Moses on
Sinai?) It follows,&mdash;"When the work was done, men
began to discover that the Law was no longer necessary."
(<i>Ibid.</i>) (Is it thus that the head-master of Rugby
accounts for, and explains the Reformation?) "The
time was come when it was fit to trust to the conscience
<i>as the supreme guide</i>." (<i>Ibid.</i>) "At the Reformation,
it might have seemed at first as if the study
of theology were about to return. But in reality an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>entirely new lesson commenced,&mdash;the lesson of toleration.
Toleration is the very opposite of dogmatism."
(p.&nbsp;43.) "Its tendency is to modify the early dogmatism
by substituting the spirit for the letter, and
practical religion for precise definitions of truth."
(<i>Ibid.</i>) "The mature mind of our race is beginning
to modify and soften the hardness and severity of the
principles which its early manhood had elevated into
immutable statements of truth. Men are beginning
to take a wider view than they did. Physical science,
researches into history, a more thorough knowledge
of the world they inhabit, have enlarged our philosophy
beyond the limits which bounded that of the
Church of the Fathers. And all these have an influence,
whether we will or no, on our determinations
of religious truth. There are found to be more things
in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in patristic
theology. <span class="smcap">God's</span> creation is a new book to be read
by the side of His revelation, and to be interpreted
as coming from Him. We can acknowledge the great
value of the forms in which the first ages of the
Church defined the truth, and yet refuse to be bound
by them." (p.&nbsp;43-4.) ... Who so unacquainted with the
method of a certain school as not to understand the
fatal meaning of generalities, false and foul as these?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It may occur to some persons to inquire whether
St. Paul, in a well-known place, does not affirm, (somewhat
as it is affirmed in this Essay,) that "the heir,
as long as he is a child, ... is under tutors and governors
until the time appointed of the father?" And
that, "Even so we, when we were children, were in
bondage under the elements of the world: but when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>the fulness of time was come, <span class="smcap">God</span> sent forth His <span class="smcap">Son</span>
... to redeem them that were under the Law, that
we might receive the adoption of sons?" Does not
St. Paul also go on to reproach men for "turning
again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto
they desired to be again in bondage?" saying, "ye
observe<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> days, and months, and times, and years<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>."
It is quite true that St. Paul says all this: and I
would fain believe that a puerile misconception of the
Apostle's meaning has betrayed the misguided author
of the present Essay into a notion that he enjoys a
species of Divine sanction for what he has written
concerning "the Education of the World." I may
add that St. Paul also declares, (in the same Epistle,)
that "the Law was our <i>p&aelig;dagogus</i> to bring us to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>.... But after faith is come, we are no longer
under a <i>p&aelig;dagogus<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></i>." He further adds an exhortation
to the Galatians, (for it is still <i>them</i> whom he is
addressing,)&mdash;"Stand fast therefore in the liberty
wherewith <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hath made us free, and be not entangled
again with the yoke of bondage<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>."&mdash;St. John
moreover, in many places, insists upon the spiritual
powers and privileges of believers, in a very remarkable
manner,&mdash;the same St. John, the same 'Apostle
of Love,' who says of a certain Doctrine which 'Essayists
and Reviewers' write as if they disbelieved,&mdash;"If
there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
receive him not into your house, neither bid
him <span class="smcap">God</span> speed: for he that biddeth him <span class="smcap">God</span> speed
is partaker of his evil deeds<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>."</p>

<p>But it does not require much knowledge of Divinity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>to make a man aware that St. Paul's meaning and
intention is as widely removed from Dr. Temple's, as
Truth is removed from falsehood: or rather, that the
Apostle is flatly against him. St. Paul is not bent on
explaining what has been <i>the Education of the World</i>,
but on pointing out in what relation <i>the Gospel of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> stands to the Law of Moses</i>. He is reproving
men who, having been converted to Christianity, were
for lapsing into Judaism. Certain of the Circumcision
had been striving, in St. Paul's absence, to bring his
Galatian converts under the bondage of the Levitical
Law; assuring them that the Gospel would avail
them nothing unless they were circumcised and obedient
to the Jewish ritual. Hence the Apostle's
vehemence, and the peculiar form which his instruction
assumes.</p>

<p>The Christian dispensation, (the scheme of Man's
Justification by Faith in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,) is the fulfilment,
(St. Paul says,) of the covenant which <span class="smcap">God</span> once solemnly
made with Abraham. The Mosaic Law, (which
was not given till 430 years after the time of Abraham,)
is powerless to cancel that earlier covenant of
Faith. What was the use of the Law, then? some
one may ask. It was a supplementary, parenthetical,
superadded thing, which came in, as it were, accidentally,
for certain assignable purposes. But now
that the original covenant of Faith has at length
found fulfilment in the person of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, it were
monstrous (argues the Apostle) to revert to Judaism:
which was a species of prison-house where we suffered
bondage until <span class="smcap">Messiah</span> came to set us free. We were
<i>as prisoners</i>, says the Apostle. We were also <i>as children</i>,
(who, anciently, from the age of six to fourteen,
used to be consigned by their father to the care of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>a slave called a 'p&aelig;dagogus;' who was neither qualified
nor allowed to teach them anything; but whose
office it was <i>to conduct them to school</i>.) So <i>brought to
the School of <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i>, where learning comes <i>by Faith</i>,
(such is his argument,) let men beware how they
revert to the carnal ordinances of the Jewish Law.</p>

<p>How different a view of our true state is thus discovered,
from that which Dr. Temple describes! A
glorious liberty is <i>in reserve</i> for us indeed<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>: a precious
freedom is ours already. But it bears no resemblance
whatever to that <i>lawlessness</i> (&#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8055;&#945; ) with which
Dr. Temple seems to be enamoured. It is the correlation
of <i>slavery</i>, not of obedience. It implies emancipation
from the <i>Levitical</i> Law, not from the sanctions,
however strict, of the <i>Christian Church</i>. The Doctrines
of Christ's kingdom are the Christian's crown
and joy. <i>His</i> "service is perfect freedom," and imparts
to life all its sweetness.&mdash;Not only, therefore,
(according to St. Paul's view of the matter,) were men
<i>not</i> released from school at "the meeting point of the
Law and the Gospel," (p.&nbsp;24,) but they only <i>began</i> to
go to School <i>then<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></i>!</p>

<p>How different a view of the Education of the World
does the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>,&mdash;does our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself&mdash;furnish,
from that which Dr. Temple here advocates!...
Fallen, in the person of Adam, and made subject to
the penalty of eternal death, behold Mankind from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>the very first taught to believe that they should be
ultimately redeemed by One born of woman. Under
the image of a son who remained in his father's house,
the favoured descendants of Abraham are set before
us: while the rest of the world is pourtrayed in the
person of another son, who goes into a far country,
and there wastes his substance with riotous living.
<i>Not</i> when grown into a colossal "youth too old for
discipline," (p.&nbsp;20, <i>bottom</i>,) but in the day of his dire
necessity, and when he begins to be sensible of his
utter need, behold the heathen nations, (in the person
of the poor prodigal,) arising, and going to their true
Father, and in the fulness of their misery asking for
a hired servant's place in the household. Behold too
<span class="smcap">God's</span> mercies in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> set forth by "the first
robe," (<i>that</i> robe of innocence which when Adam lost
he knew that he was naked!) and the ring, and the
shoes, and the fatted calf! Lastly, in the embrace
which the Father, (while yet the offending but repentant
son is a long way off,) <i>runs</i> to bestow,&mdash;behold
<i>how</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> loved the World!</p>

<p>But Dr. Temple may say,&mdash;<i>My</i> parable relates to
one person: that which you have quoted pourtrays
two, and thus all parallelism is lost. (In other words,
<i>our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> picture</i> of "the Education of the World"
<i>is altogether unlike Dr. Temple's</i>!)&mdash;Take, however, a
parable which ought to suit exactly; for in it mankind
are exhibited in the person of "a certain man."</p>

<p>This individual is represented as one who, as he
travels, is by thieves stripped, wounded, and left half
dead. Such then, by nature, is the state of the human
race! Priest and Levite, who "look on him,"
but "pass by on the other side," set forth the Education
of the World&nbsp;(!) until <span class="smcap">Christ</span> came. A certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>Samaritan, who has compassion on the naked and
wounded wretch, goes to him, binds up his wounds,
pours in oil and wine, sets him on his own beast,
brings him to the inn, and takes care of him:&mdash;<i>this</i>
one is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. The stranger's pence, and his promise
to repay at his second coming what shall have been
over-expended,&mdash;set forth, I suppose, <i>that</i> ministration
of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> Word and Sacraments which Dr.
Temple exercises.... Let me dismiss the subject by
remarking that I find no countenance given by Holy
Scripture to Dr. Temple's monstrous notions concerning
the Infancy, the Youth, and the Manhood of the
Colossal Man.</p>

<p>Our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span> is indeed set before us in
Scripture as our great Exemplar<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; and St. Paul calls
upon us to be followers, or rather imitators, (&#956;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#8055;),
of himself; even as <i>he</i> was of <span class="smcap">Christ</span><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. But this
walking by example, did not supersede the walking
by precept; neither was it to endure, (<span class="smcap">God</span> forbid!)
(as Dr. Temple emphatically says it was), (pp.&nbsp;26:
28-9,) only for about a hundred years: still less was
"Example," (the second Teacher of the Human
Race,) straightway to find itself supplanted by "the
Spirit or Conscience" of Man,&mdash;"the third great
Teacher, and the last." What need to say that
until His Second Coming to judge the world, we
shall have <i>no</i> Teacher but <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;<i>no</i> other way
proposed to us to walk in, but that which the Gospel
discloses?</p>

<p>Neither is it true that the world has been old
enough, for the last 1800 years, to be taught by "<i>seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>the lives of Saints</i>," (a sentiment worthy of the
weakest of Romanists!) "<i>better than by hearing the
words of Prophets</i>." (pp.&nbsp;28-9.) The Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
will for ever listen to the blessed accents of that
"goodly fellowship," until she beholds Him by whose
Spirit they spake<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, coming again to judgment. True
that the object with which she will all along <i>inform</i> her
children, will ever be that they may become <i>conformed</i>
to the model of her Divine <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. But "sound doctrine<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>,"&mdash;embodied
in a "form of sound words<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,"&mdash;constitutes
that &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#954;&#951;, or "deposit," which
is her proudest inheritance and her greatest treasure<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:
and impatience of it is a note of evil men, and of
a season at which Prophecy points her awful finger<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>....
"Lawlessness," (&#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8055;&#945;,) is discoursed of by the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> with a mysterious earnestness which it seems
to me impossible to survey without mingled awe and
terror lest one may become oneself involved in the
threatened condemnation. I allude of course especially
to what St. Paul says in his second Epistle to the
Thessalonians; the language of which, to be understood,
must be studied in the original<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>Conscience has her office, doubtless; and a most
important one it is. Conscience is the very candle
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> within us. But, (as I have elsewhere
shewn,) it were base treason to speak of conscience as
Essayists and Reviewers speak of it. With <i>them</i>, it is
indeed impossible to argue. They must first withdraw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>from the cause which they have betrayed; cease
to profess the teaching which they disbelieve; resign
their commission in a Church to whose Doctrine and
Discipline they openly proclaim themselves to be
opposed. I will not argue <i>with them</i>, while they presume
to write B.D. and D.D. after their names,&mdash;hold
Chaplaincies,&mdash;preside over Schools and Colleges,&mdash;profess
to lecture in Divinity,&mdash;officiate at the altars
of the Church of England,&mdash;by virtue of their sacred
office, <i>and by virtue of that only</i>, are instructors of
youth. They <i>cannot</i>, (if they are in the full enjoyment
of their faculties,) they <i>cannot</i> imagine, for a
moment, that, as honest men, they can remain where
they are! They <i>must</i> either recal their words or
resign their stations!</p>

<p>But speaking to others, it will abundantly suffice
to point out that such principles as the present Essay
advocates are incompatible with the profession of
Christianity in <i>any</i> country, and in <i>any</i> age. If the
spirit or conscience of Man is to legislate "<i>without
appeal except to himself</i>;" (p.&nbsp;31;) if men are to "<i>refuse
to be bound</i>" (p.&nbsp;44.) by the Creeds of the Church;
if the very Bible is not to be looked upon as "<i>an
outer law</i>:" (p.&nbsp;45:)&mdash;how is sentence <i>ever</i> to be pronounced
with authority? how are men to know <i>what</i>
they have to believe? how are we to enjoy the guidance
of any "outer law" <i>at all</i>? I do not ask these
questions as a clergyman; neither am I addressing
those exclusively who have been admitted to the Christian
priesthood. Common sense, ordinary piety, natural
reverence, seem to cry out, and ask,&mdash;If <i>the Church</i>
have no "authority in controversies of Faith<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>;" if <i>the
three Creeds</i> ought not "thoroughly to be received and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>believed<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>;" if <i>the Bible</i> is not "an outer Law;"&mdash;<i>where</i>
is Authority in things Divine to be sought for? <i>What</i>
can be worthy of credit? <i>Where</i> are we to look for
external guidance on this side the grave?... Surely,
surely, common sense is outraged when she hears it
insisted that the written Bible is a Revelation speaking
<span class="smcap">not</span> "from without," but "from within!" (pp.
36 and 45.) Surely it must be admitted that it were
mere atheism to pretend that Man's "spirit or conscience,
<i>without appeal except to himself</i>," shall henceforth
be the governing principle of Mankind!</p>

<p>Let me in conclusion do this writer an act of justice,
(for which he will not perhaps altogether thank me,)
even while with shame and sorrow I now dismiss his
Essay. Unpardonable as he is for having written
thus; and <i>wholly</i> without excuse for having suffered
<i>nine editions</i> of his blasphemous allegory to go forth to
the world without apology, explanation, or retractation
of any kind,&mdash;although he labours under a weight of
competent censure without a parallel, I believe, in
the annals of the English Church<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>: notwithstanding
all this, I am bound to say that if the unbelievers of
this generation think they have an ally in <i>the man</i>,
Frederick Temple,&mdash;they are very much mistaken.
That so pure a heart, and earnest a spirit, will never
work itself free of its present bondage,&mdash;I should be
sorry indeed to think. (But O the mischief which
the head-master of Rugby School will have done in
the meantime!) His misfortune (or rather fault) it
has been, that he has really never studied Divinity;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>nor, in fact, <i>knows anything at all about it</i>,&mdash;as a volume
of his, lately published, sufficiently shews. Apart
from his opinions&nbsp;(!), he is a thoroughly amiable man;
and&mdash;(with the same proviso!)&mdash;an excellent schoolmaster;
but when he ventures upon the province of
Theology, he shews himself something infinitely worse
than <i>a very bad Divine</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>II. On turning the first page of the review which
follows, "by <span class="smcap">Rowland Williams, D.D.</span> Vice-Principal
and Professor of Hebrew, St. David's College, Lampeter;
Vicar of Broad Chalke, Wilts,"&mdash;we are made
sensible that we are in company of a writer considerably
in advance of Dr. Temple, though altogether of
the same school. In fact, if Dr. Williams had not
been Vice-Principal of a Theological College, and a
Doctor of Divinity, one would have supposed him to
be a complete infidel,&mdash;who found it convenient to
vent his own unbelief in a highly laudatory review of
the principles of the late Baron Bunsen. Hear him:&mdash;"When
Bunsen asks 'How long shall we bear this
fiction of an external Revelation,'&mdash;that is, of one
violating the heart and conscience, instead of expressing
itself through them;&mdash;or when he says, 'All this
is delusion for those who believe it; but what is it in
the mouths of those who teach it?'&mdash;Or when he exclaims,
'Oh the fools! who, if they do see the imminent
perils of this age, think to ward them off by
narrow-minded persecution'!&mdash;and when he repeats,
'Is it not time, in truth, to withdraw the veil from
our misery? to tear off the mask from hypocrisy,
and destroy that sham which is undermining all
real ground under our feet? to point out the dangers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>which surround, nay, threaten already to engulf us?'&mdash;there
will be some who think his language too
vehement for good taste. Others will think burning
words needed by the disease of our time. These will
not quarrel on points of taste with a man who in our
darkest perplexity has reared again the banner of
Truth, and uttered thoughts which gave courage to
the weak and sight to the blind. If Protestant Europe
is to escape those shadows of the twelfth century
which with ominous recurrence are closing around us,
to Baron Bunsen will belong a foremost place among
the champions of light and right." (pp.&nbsp;92-3.)</p>

<p>But even the Prussian infidel is not advanced
enough for the Vicar of Broad Chalke. Bunsen, it
seems, was weak enough to believe that the prophet
Jonah was a real personage. This evokes the following
singular burst of critical indignation from the
Reverend author of the present Essay:&mdash;"It provokes
a smile on serious topics,"&mdash;(a kind of impropriety
which the Vice-Principal of Lampeter will not commit
except under protest and with an apology!)&mdash;"to
observe the zeal with which our critic vindicates the
personality of Jonah, and the originality of his hymn,
(the latter being generally thought doubtful), while
he proceeds to explain that the narrative of our book
in which the hymn is imbedded, contains a late legend
founded on misconception. One can imagine
the cheers which the opening of such an essay might
evoke in some of our circles, changing into indignation&nbsp;(!)
as the distinguished foreigner developed his
views. After this he might speak more gently of
mythical theories." (p.&nbsp;77.)</p>

<p>For the most part, however, the Vicar of Broad
Chalke is able to cite the opinions of Bunsen with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>admiration and approval. They are both agreed that
the Deluge "was but a prolonged play of the forces
of fire and water rendering the prim&aelig;val regions of
North Asia uninhabitable, and urging the nations to
new abodes." (Of what nature this "<i>prolonged play</i>"
was, is however left unexplained: while "<i>the forces of
fire and water</i> rendering <i>prim&aelig;val regions</i> uninhabitable,"
and "<i>urging</i> nations to new abodes," has altogether
a Herodotean sound.) "We learn approximately
its antiquity, and infer limitation in its range
from finding it recorded in the traditions of Iran and
Palestine, (or of Japheth and Shem), but unknown to
the Egyptians and Mongolians." (p.&nbsp;56.) (A delightful
method truly of attaining historical precision in
a matter of this nature!) ... "In the <i>half ideal, half
traditional</i> notices of the beginnings of our race compiled
in Genesis, we are bid notice the combination
of documents and the recurrence of barely consistent
Genealogies." (<i>Ibid.</i>) Praise is at hand for
"the firmness with which Bunsen relegates the long
lives of the first patriarchs to the domain of legend,
or of symbolical cycle." (p.&nbsp;57.) "The historical
portion begins with Abraham." (<i>Ibid.</i>)&mdash;After this admission,
it is instructive to observe how the learned
writer deals with the narrative. The Exode was
"a struggle conducted by human means." (p.&nbsp;59.)
"Thus, as the pestilence of the Book of Kings becomes
in Chronicles the more visible angel, so the
avenger who slew the firstborn may have been the
Bedouin host,&nbsp;(!) akin nearly to Jethro, and more remotely
to Israel." (<i>Ibid.</i>) (It is really hardly worth
stopping to point out that by 'Kings' the Reverend
writer means 'the second Book of Samuel:' and to
remind the reader that <i>the Angel is mentioned as ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>pressly
in Samuel as in Chronicles<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></i>. Also, to ask what
'the Bedouin host' could have been doing <i>in Egypt</i>
previous to the Exode?) "The passage of the Red
Sea may be interpreted with the latitude of poetry."
(<i>Ibid.</i>) "Moses would gladly have founded a free
religious society, ... but the rudeness or hardness
of his people's heart compelled him to a sacerdotal
system and formal tablets of stone." (p.&nbsp;62.) Nay,
Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac was an act of
obedience to "the fierce ritual of Syria, with the awe
of a Divine voice:" (p.&nbsp;61:) while the Divine command,
in conformity with which Abraham spared to
slay his son, is resolved into an allegory. "He trusted
that the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, whose voice from Heaven he heard
at heart, was better pleased with mercy than with
sacrifice, and this trust was his righteousness." (p.&nbsp;61.)
Dr. Williams straightway shews us how <i>we</i> may tread
in the steps of faithful Abraham. The perpetual response
of our hearts, (he says,) to principles of Reason
and Right of our own tracing, is a truer sign of faith
than deference to a supposed external authority. (p.&nbsp;61.)
... According to this writer, therefore, Genesis and
Exodus are pure fable!</p>

<p>The whole of Scripture, in the hands of this Doctor
of Divinity, undergoes corresponding treatment. They
who "twist Prophecy into harmony with the details
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>of Gospel history, fall into inextricable contradictions."
(pp.&nbsp;64-5.) "The Book of Isaiah, as composed of elements
of different eras," can only be accepted with
a "modified theory of authorship and of prediction."
(p.&nbsp;68.) In the prophecy of Zechariah are "three distinct
styles and aspects of affairs." (<i>Ibid.</i>) "The
cursing Psalms,"&nbsp;(!!!) he informs us, were not "evangelically
inspired;" (p.&nbsp;63;) and yet we are constrained
to remember that the cixth Psalm (specially alluded to)
is evangelically interpreted by St. Peter<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. The true
translation of Psalm xxii. 17, (learnedly discussed,
long since, by Bishop Pearson,) is not "they pierced
My hands and My feet,"&mdash;but "like a lion;" (notwithstanding
that Pearson has shewn that the substitution
of <i>vau</i> for <i>yod</i> in this place is one of the
eighteen instances where the Scribes have tampered
with the text<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; and notwithstanding that this modern
corruption of the Hebrew, as every one must see,
makes the place almost nonsense<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.)&mdash;Is. vii. 14 does
not refer to the miraculous birth of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, (p.&nbsp;69,)
(although St. Matthew is express in his assertion
that it <i>does</i>.) There is, it seems, an elder and a later
Isaiah, (p.&nbsp;71.) The famous liiird chapter does not
refer to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; but either to Jeremiah or to "the
collective Israel,"&mdash;(p.&nbsp;73,) (although it is at least
seven times quoted, and expressly applied to our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, in the New Testament<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.) Daniel, we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>assured, belongs to different ages; and it is "certain,
beyond fair doubt ... that those portions of the book,
supposed to be specially predictive, are ... a history of
past occurrences." (p.&nbsp;69.) That "the book contains
no predictions, except by analogy and type, can hardly
be gainsaid." (pp.&nbsp;76-7.) ... (If any of <i>us</i> had dogmatized
as to Truth as these men do as to error,
(remarks Dr. Pusey,) what scorn we should be held up
to!) ... The Reverend author insolently adds,&mdash;"It
is time for divines to recognize these things, since
with their opportunities of study, the current error
is as discreditable to them, as for the well-meaning
crowd, who are taught to identify it with their creed,
it is a matter of grave compassion." (p.&nbsp;77.) "When so
vast an induction on the destructive side has been
gone through, it avails little that some passages may
be doubtful; one perhaps in Zechariah, and one in
Isaiah, capable of being made directly Messianic;
and a chapter possibly in Deuteronomy foreshadowing
the final fall of Jerusalem. Even these few cases, the
remnant of so much confident rhetoric, tend to melt,
if they are not already melted, in the crucible of
searching enquiry." (pp.&nbsp;69-70.) ... Our Doctor of
Divinity, having reduced the prophecies <i>"capable of
being made"</i> Messianic, to <i>two</i>,&mdash;breaks out into a strain
of refined banter which is altogether his own, and
which we presume is intended to stand in the place
of argument. "If our German, [viz. Bunsen,] had
ignored all that the masters of philology have proved
on these subjects, his countrymen would have raised a
storm of ridicule, at which he must have drowned himself
in the Neckar." (p.&nbsp;70.) A catastrophe so fatal to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>the cause of true Religion and sound learning may well
point a paragraph!... But we must write gravely.</p>

<p>The absolute worthlessness of unsupported dicta
such as these, ought to be apparent to all. It is useless
to reason with a madman. We desiderate nothing
so much as "searching enquiry," (p.&nbsp;69,) but we are
presented instead with something worse than random
assertion. If the writer would state a single case,
with its evidence,&mdash;we should know how to deal with
him. We should examine his arguments seriatim;
and either refute them, or admit their validity. From
such "free handling," the cause of sacred Truth can
never suffer. But when, in place of argument and
evidence, we have merely bluster,&mdash;what is to be said?
Pity and disregard are the only reply we can bestow;
or our answers must be as brief as the calumny which
provokes them. "How," (asks the Regius Professor
of Hebrew,) "can such an undigested heap of errors
receive a systematic answer in brief space, or in any
one treatise or volume?"</p>

<p>"If any sincere Christian now asks, is not then our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> spoken of in Isaiah; let him open his New
Testament, and ask therewith John the Baptist, whether
he was Elias? If he finds the Baptist answering
<i>I am not</i>, yet our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> testifies that in spirit and
power this was Elias; a little reflexion will shew how
the historical representation in Isaiah liii. is of some
suffering prophet or remnant, yet the truth and
patience, the grief and triumph, have their highest
fulfilment in Him who said, '<span class="smcap">Father</span>, not My will
but Thine.'" (p.&nbsp;74.) I have transcribed this passage
to illustrate the miserable sophistry of the author. It
is foretold by Malachi that before the great and terrible
day of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Elijah is to come back to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>Earth<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. John Baptist came in his "spirit and power<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>,"
but was not Elijah himself. How does it follow from
this that Isaiah may have prophesied merely of <i>qualities</i>
and not of a person? The only logical inference
from his words would surely be, that Elijah is yet to
come<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>!&mdash;Dr. Williams adds,&mdash;"We must not distort
the prophets to prove the Divine <span class="smcap">Word</span> incarnate,
and then from the Incarnation reason back to the
sense of prophecy." (p.&nbsp;74.) <i>Was</i> not then the Divine
<span class="smcap">Word</span> incarnate?</p>

<p>The theory of one who writes like an open unbeliever
concerning Divine things is really not worth
developing: and yet, as I am examining an Essay
which seems to be entirely built upon such a theory,
it may be desirable, in this instance, that the deformity
of the writer should be uncovered: especially
since Dr. Williams writes such very dark English,
that, until some of his sentences are translated, they
are barely intelligible.</p>

<p>Anticipating that his doctrines may "alarm those
who think that, apart from <i>Omniscience belonging to
the Jews</i>,&nbsp;(!) the proper conclusion of reason is Atheism;"&mdash;(in
other words, that the rejection of a belief
in <i>the inspiration of Prophecy</i> will eventually conduct
a man to the rejection of <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself;) the Reverend
writer declares that "it is not inconsistent
with the idea that <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span> has been pleased to
educate men and nations, employing imagination no
less than conscience, and suffering His lessons to play
freely within the limits of humanity and its shortcomings."
(p.&nbsp;77.) (In other words, that what Scripture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>emphatically declares, and what men have for
thousands of years believed to be inspired predictions
of future events, are none other than the effusions
of a lively imagination, or the suggestions of a well-informed
conscience.) "The prophetical disquisitions,"
(p.&nbsp;77,) therefore, are subject to error of every
imaginable description; and possess no higher attributes
than belong to any ordinary human work by
"a master's hand." (p.&nbsp;77.) "The Sacred Writers
acknowledge themselves men of like passions with
ourselves, and we are promised illumination from the
Spirit which dwelt in them." (p.&nbsp;78.) We may not
think of the Sacred Writers as "passionless machines,
and call Luther and Milton 'uninspired.'" (<i>Ibid.</i>)
"The great result is to vindicate the work of the
Eternal Spirit; that abiding influence which underlies
all others, and in which converge all images of
old time and means of grace now: temple, Scripture,
finger, and Hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and again, preaching,
sacraments, waters which comfort, and flame which
burns." (p.&nbsp;78.) It follows,&mdash;"If such a Spirit did
not dwell in the Church, the Bible would not be
inspired, for <i>the Bible is</i>, before all things, <i>the written
voice of the congregation</i>." (p.&nbsp;78.) Offended Reason,
(for Piety has no place here,) has not time to reclaim
against so preposterous a statement; for it follows
immediately,&mdash;"Bold as such a theory of Inspiration&nbsp;(!)
may sound, it was the earliest creed of the
Church, and it is the only one to which the facts of
Scripture answer." (p.&nbsp;78.) ... What reply <i>can</i> be
offered to such an outrageous statement, but flat contradiction?
What more effectual refutation of such
a 'theory' (?) concerning Scripture, than simply to
state it?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
Let this miserable but conceited man yet further
map out the nature of his own delusion respecting
Prophecy. He applauds the wisdom of one who
"accepts freely the belief of scholars, and yet does not
despair of Hebrew Prophecy as a witness to the Kingdom
of God:" (p.&nbsp;70:) (that is, of one who, like
Bunsen, altogether disbelieves in prophecy <i>as prophecy</i>,
and yet is bent on finding something of an Evangelical
character in the prophetic writings.) "The
way of doing so left open to him, was to shew pervading
the Prophets those deep truths which lie at
the heart of Christianity, and to trace the growth of
such ideas, the belief in a righteous <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the
nearness of Man to <span class="smcap">God</span>, the power of prayer, and
the victory of self-sacrificing patience, ever expanding
in men's hearts, until the fulness of time came, and
the ideal of the Divine thought was fulfilled in the
Son of Man." (p.&nbsp;70.) In other words, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was
nothing more than the fullest development and impersonation
of the best thoughts and feelings of the
(so-called) prophets! He "fulfilled in His own person
the highest aspiration of Hebrew seers and of mankind,
thereby lifting the ancient words, so to speak,
into a new and higher power; and therefore was
recognized as having eminently the unction of a prophet
whose words die not,&mdash;of a priest in a temple
not made with hands,&mdash;and of a king in the realm of
thought, delivering his people from a bondage of
moral evil, worse than Egypt or Babylon." (pp.&nbsp;74-5.)
"A notion of <i>foresight by vision of particulars</i>, or a kind
of clairvoyance," (p.&nbsp;70,)&mdash;(such is this Doctor of Divinity's
notion of the gift of prophecy!)&mdash;he deems inadmissible.
"<i>Literal prognostication</i>," (p.&nbsp;65,) is his
abhorrence. He would eliminate the Messianic pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>sages
altogether. (pp.&nbsp;65-6.) That Prophecy was miraculous,
was a dream of the Fathers, (p.&nbsp;66.) Even
the notion that Prophecy is "a natural gift, consistent
with fallibility," (p.&nbsp;70,) Dr. Williams rejects as an
unwarrantable addition to the "moral and metaphysical
basis of Prophecy." (p.&nbsp;70.) Bunsen was for admitting
that addition. "One would wish," (says the
Vicar of Broad Chalke,) "<i>he might have intended only
the power of seeing the ideal in the actual</i>, or of tracing
the Divine Government in the movements of men.
He seems to mean <i>more than presentiment or sagacity</i>:
and this element in his system requires proof."
(pp.&nbsp;70-1.) ... This, from a Doctor of Divinity! a
Professor of Hebrew! the Vice-Principal of a Theological
College! a shepherd of souls!</p>

<p>We are left to infer that "the Fall of Adam represents
ideally the circumscription of our spirits in
limits of flesh and time:" (p.&nbsp;88:) that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is
"the moral Saviour of mankind;" (p.&nbsp;80;) and that
Salvation from evil is to be attained by the conformity
of our souls to a "<i>religious idea</i>" which was "brought
to perfection" in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. (p.&nbsp;80.) This "religious
idea" "is the thought of the Eternal." (<i>Ibid.</i>) In
other words, "Salvation from evil" is "through
sharing the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>'s Spirit." (p.&nbsp;87.)&mdash;We are further
left to infer that "Justification by faith means
the peace of mind, or sense of Divine approval, which
comes of trust in a righteous <span class="smcap">God</span>:" (p.&nbsp;80:) that
"Regeneration is a correspondent giving of insight,
or an awakening of forces of the soul: Resurrection,
a spiritual quickening: Salvation, our deliverance, not
from the life-giving <span class="smcap">God</span>, but from evil and darkness."
(p.&nbsp;81.) ... And this from a Clergyman who has
just subscribed, "willingly and <i>ex animo</i>," the three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>Articles in the 36th Canon!... After such specimens
of Divinity, we are scarcely surprised to find that
the fires of Hell &#947;&#8051;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945; "may serve as images of
distracted remorse:" (p.&nbsp;81:) that "Heaven is not a
place<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, so much as a fulfilment of the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>."
(pp.&nbsp;81-2.) The very Incarnation, (which he calls "the
embodiment of the Eternal Mind,") (p.&nbsp;82.) is spoken
of as if it were a myth. "It becomes with our author
<i>as purely spiritual</i> as it was with St. Paul. The Son
of David by birth is the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>by the spirit of
holiness</i>. What is flesh, is born of flesh; and what is
spirit, is born of Spirit." (p.&nbsp;82.) Rom. i. 1-3 is
quoted in support of this, which I cannot but regard
as blasphemy: for if it does not mean that our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
was not, in a true and literal sense, the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> at
all, it is hard to see <i>what</i> it can mean.&mdash;As for the
following account of the mystery of the Blessed Trinity,
it shall only be said that it sounds like a denial
of the Catholic doctrine altogether. "Being, becoming,
and animating; or substance, thinking, and conscious
life, are expressions of a Triad which may be
also represented as will, wisdom, and love; as light,
radiance, and warmth; as fountain, stream, and united
flow; as mind, thought, and consciousness; as person,
word, and life; as <span class="smcap">Father, Son</span>, and <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>." (p.&nbsp;88.)</p>

<p>The <i>nebulous</i> is a striking peculiarity of the style
of the Vicar of Broad Chalke<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. He informs us that
"in virtue of the identity of Thought with Being the
primitive Trinity represented neither three originant
principles nor three transient phases, but three eternal
subsistences in one Divine Mind.... The Divine
Consciousness or Wisdom, consubstantial with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>Eternal Will, becoming personal in the Son of Man,
is the express image of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>; and <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> actually,
but also Mankind ideally, is the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>."
(pp.&nbsp;88-9.) Since this has "almost a Brahmanical
sound" (p.&nbsp;89.) even to the Vicar of Broad Chalke,
we are content to pass it by in mute astonishment.
He proceeds: "Both spiritual affection and metaphysical
reasoning forbid us to confine Revelations
like those of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> to the first half century of our
era; but shew at least affinities of our faith existing
in men's minds, anterior to Christianity, and renewed
with deep echo from living hearts in many a generation."
(p.&nbsp;82.) Was our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> then a fabulous
personage,&mdash;a virtuous principle,&mdash;and not a Man?...
"Again. We find the evidences of our canonical books
and of the patristic authors nearest to them, are sufficient
to prove illustration in outward act of principles
perpetually true, but not adequate to guarantee narratives
inherently incredible or precepts evidently
wrong." (pp.&nbsp;82-3.) Are then the sacred "narratives"
"inherently incredible?" or the Divine "precepts"
"evidently wrong?"&mdash;These are, we presume, among
the "traditional fictions about our Canon" (p.&nbsp;83.)
at which the Theological Professor sneers. "Hence
we are obliged to assume in ourselves a verifying
faculty,"&mdash;(p.&nbsp;83,) and so, Dr. Williams and Dr.
Temple shake hands<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. An instance of the exercise of
this faculty is immediately subjoined. "The verse
'And no man hath ascended up to Heaven, but he
that came down,' is intelligible as a free comment
near the end of the first century; but has no meaning
in our Lord's mouth at a time when the Ascension
had not been heard of." (p.&nbsp;84.)&mdash;"The Apocalypse"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>in like manner, to "cease to be a riddle," must be
"taken as a series of poetical visions which represent
the outpouring of the vials of wrath upon the City
where our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was slain." (p.&nbsp;84.) ... (Is it possible
that a Minister of the Gospel of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> can speak thus
concerning the Divine record?) ... "The second of
the Petrine Epistles, having alike external and internal
evidence against its genuineness, is necessarily surrendered
as a whole." (p.&nbsp;84.) (Can a man solemnly
sign the vith Article, and yet so write?)&mdash;"A philosophical
view [of the doctrine of the Trinity] recommends
itself as easiest to believe." (p.&nbsp;87.) The
"view" expressed in the Athanasian Creed is we
presume that which is stigmatized as "one felt to be
so irrational, that it calls in the aid of terror." (p.&nbsp;87.)
The Reverend writer does not <i>name</i> the Athanasian
Creed, indeed. It is not the general fashion of Essayists
and Reviewers,&mdash;from Dr. Temple to Professor
Jowett,&mdash;to speak plainly. But common sense asks,&mdash;If
Dr. Williams does <i>not</i> allude to the Creed in
question, what <i>does</i> he allude to? And common
honesty adds,&mdash;How is such an allusion to that formula
consistent with subscription to Art. viii.?</p>

<p>The Sacrament of Baptism, (he says,) has "degenerated
into a magical form," (p.&nbsp;86,) since it has
"become twisted into a false analogy with circumcision,"&mdash;(twisted,
at all events, by St. Paul<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>!)&mdash;and
it is merely an "Augustinian notion" that "a curse
is inherited by Infants."&mdash;How, one humbly asks,
does the Reverend writer reconcile it to his conscience
not only to have signed the ixth Article, but to employ
the Baptismal Service, and to teach the little
ones of the flock their Catechism?</p>

On reaching the last page of the present Essay, one
is irresistibly led to remark that if a single word could
convey an adequate notion of the author's manner,
that word would be <i>Insolence</i>. When Dr. Williams
would express difference of opinion, he has recourse
to violence and bluster: when he would patronize, he
is sure to make himself unspeakably offensive. But
he seldom agrees with anybody, even with disciples
of the same school with himself,&mdash;as Messrs. Bunsen
and Arnold, Coleridge and Francis Newman. Professor
Mansel is "a mere gladiator hitting in the
dark," whose "blows fall heaviest on what it was his
duty to defend." (p.&nbsp;67.) Dr. Pusey receives a menacing
intimation of what his Commentary must <i>not</i>
be. Davison's reasoning labours under the inconvenient
defect of an unproved minor premiss. (p.&nbsp;66.)
The majestic memory of Bp. Pearson is insulted by
this vulgar man, and the fairness of his citations are
impeached. (p.&nbsp;72.)&mdash;Bp. Butler is declared to have
turned aside from an unwelcome idea&nbsp;(!), literature
not being his strong point&nbsp;(!) (p.&nbsp;65.)&mdash;Justin, (p.&nbsp;64,)&mdash;Augustine,
(p.&nbsp;65,)&mdash;Jerome, (pp.&nbsp;65, 71,)&mdash;Anselm,
(p.&nbsp;67,)&mdash;all come in for a share of the Vice-Principal
of Lampeter's contempt. Even the Apologist of <i>Essays
and Reviews</i> is constrained to admit that "anything
more" <i>un</i>becoming "than some of Dr. Williams's
remarks we have never read, in writings professing to
be written seriously<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>."</p>

<p>But faults of mind and manner, however gross, do
but disqualify a writer for being the associate of men
of taste and good breeding; and blemishes of style
are, at least, venial. Not so easily to be excused is
the deplorable spectacle of a Minister of the Gospel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>a Doctor of Divinity and Vice-Principal of a Theological
College, lending all his critical powers, (which
yet seem to be of the most indifferent description,)
in order to undermine the authority of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word.
He has been asked,&mdash;"Do you unfeignedly believe
all the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testament?"
and he has answered,&mdash;"I do believe them."
He has been asked, "Will you be ready, with all diligence,
to banish and drive away all erroneous and
strange doctrines contrary to <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word?" and he
has made reply,&mdash;"I will, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> being my helper."
He has solemnly declared his trust that he was "<i>inwardly
moved by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> to take upon himself
this office and ministration</i>."&mdash;Yet this is the man who
explains away Miracles, denies Prophecy, and idealizes
Scripture; the man who disparages the formul&aelig; he
uses daily, mutilates the Canon, and evacuates the
most solemn doctrines of the Church!</p>

<p>I have now said as much as I think necessary concerning
Dr. Williams's Essay. The entire refutation
of such a tissue of groundless assertions and unfounded
statements, and unscholarlike criticisms, and unphilosophical
views,&mdash;would fill many volumes. It is to
be feared also that, to <i>him</i>, the result would not be
convincing after all. To have stated in brief outline,
as I have already done, the leading positions to which
he commits himself, ought to suffice. The mere exhibition
of such principles (?) ought to be their own
abundant refutation.... <span class="smcap">God</span> give the unhappy author
repentance of his errors!&mdash;And will not men believe
that in the pages of the present Essay is to be seen
the lawful development, and inevitable result of the
opinions advocated <i>in every other part</i> of the present
volume? I perceive scarcely any <i>essential</i> difference
between the views of any of these seven writers. All
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>are moving along the same fatal road; and are simply
at different stages of the journey. But they
conduct themselves wondrous differently in their
progress, certainly; Dr. Williams being immeasurably
the most offensive of the seven,&mdash;the only
one who, besides seeming blasphemous, can truly be
called <i>vulgar</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>III. The third Essay in the present volume is by
"the <span class="smcap">Rev. Baden Powell</span>, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian
Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford,"&mdash;a
gentleman with whose labours I shall deal briefly
and gently for two reasons. His assertions admit of
summary refutation; and he has already, (alas!)
passed beyond the limit of earthly Criticism. I desire
to add concerning him, that in the private relations
of life he was a friendly and amiable person.</p>

<p>The solemn circumstance already adverted to, would
have kept me silent altogether. When a writer is no
longer able to defend himself, it is ungenerous to attack
him: and at a time when he knows far more
wonders than are dreamed of by any one on the Earth's
surface, it seems unbecoming to stand reasoning over
his grave about an "antecedent probability." But I
am addressing not the dead, but the living,&mdash;to whom,
in the pages of 'Essays and Reviews,' Professor Powell
"being dead yet speaketh."</p>

<p>He entitles his contribution,&mdash;"On the Study of
the Evidences of Christianity:" but, as often happens
with performances of the like nature, the title of his
Essay gives a wrong notion of its contents. It ought
to have been called "The Validity of <span class="smcap">the Evidence
from Miracles</span> considered," or rather "denied."</p>

<p>There is nothing new in the present attack on the
Miracles of Scripture. The author disposes of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>by a single assertion. "What is alleged," (he says,)
"is a case of the supernatural. <i>But no testimony can
reach to the supernatural.</i>" (p.&nbsp;107.) The inference
is obvious.&mdash;Again: "an event may be so incredible
intrinsically as to <i>set aside any degree of testimony</i>."
(p.&nbsp;106.) Such an event he declares a Miracle to be;
and explains that "from the nature of our antecedent
convictions, the probability of <i>some</i> kind of mistake
or deception <i>somewhere</i>, though we know not <i>where</i>,
is greater than the probability of the event really
happening in <i>the way</i>, and from <i>the causes</i> assigned."
(pp.&nbsp;106-7.) This merely amounts to asserting that
the antecedent improbability of Miracles is so great
as to make them incredible. The writer does not
attempt to establish this point. "The present discussion,"
(he says,) "is not intended to be of a controversial
kind; it is purely contemplative and theoretical."
(p.&nbsp;100.) And yet, he <i>cannot</i> suppose that
the Universal Church will surrender its convictions
and reverse its deliberate judgment, at the merely
"contemplative and theoretical" suggestions of an
individual, however respectable he may happen to be.
Against his mere assertion, we claim a right to set
the result of Bp. Butler's careful investigation of the
same subject:&mdash;"<i>That there certainly is no such presumption
against Miracles, as to render them in any wise
incredible</i>: that, on the contrary, our being able to
discern reasons for them, gives a positive credibility
to the history of them, in cases where those reasons
hold: and that it is by no means certain that there
is any peculiar presumption at all, from analogy, even
in the lowest degree, against Miracles, as distinguished
from other extraordinary phenomena<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
Professor Powell's objection against Miracles is,
in fact, practically that of the infidel Hume; who
asserted "that no testimony for any kind of Miracle
can ever possibly amount to a probability,
much less to a proof." He argued that Miracles,
being contrary to general experience, are incapable
of proof. He maintained also, (with Spinoza,)
that Miracles, being contrary to the established
laws of Nature, imply, in the very character of
them, a palpable contradiction. This latter position
seems to be identical with that adopted by Professor
Powell.</p>

<p>In a certain place, this author finds fault with "the
too frequent assumption ... of the part of the ...
<i>Advocate</i>, when the character to be sustained should
be rather that of the unbiassed <i>Judge</i>." (p.&nbsp;95.) But
what are we to think of the judicial fairness of one
who is not only Advocate and Judge in his own cause;
but who even turns the Witnesses out of Court; and
will listen to no evidence,&mdash;on the plea that it <i>cannot</i>
be trustworthy; or at least, that it <i>shall</i> be unavailing?&mdash;"I
express myself with caution," (says Bp.
Butler, with reference to arguments against the credibility
of Revelation,) "lest I should be mistaken
to vilify Reason; which is indeed the only faculty we
have wherewith to judge concerning anything, even
Revelation itself: or be misunderstood to assert that
a supposed revelation cannot be proved false, from
internal characters. For it may contain clear immoralities,
or contradictions; and either of these would
prove it false. Nor will I take upon me to affirm,
that nothing else can possibly render any supposed
revelation incredible. Yet still the observation is, I
think, true beyond doubt; that <i>objections against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>Christianity, as distinguished from objections against its
evidence, are frivolous<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></i>."</p>

<p>That a certain occurrence or phenomenon "is due
to supernatural causes," Professor Powell maintains is
"entirely dependent on the previous belief and assumptions
of the parties." (p.&nbsp;107.) He forgets that
he grounds his own denial of the possibility of a
Miracle, on nothing stronger than "the nature of"
his own "antecedent convictions." Thus, the question
becomes merely a personal one between Mr. Baden
Powell and the Apostles of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. The reasonableness
of the "antecedent convictions" in the one case
have to be set against the reasonableness of the "antecedent
convictions" in the other. Either party, (according
to this view,) has its own "previous belief
and assumptions;" which, in the one case, are known
to have produced conviction; in the other, they are
unhappily found to have resulted in a rejection of
Miracles. But then it happens, unfortunately, that
in the case of the Apostles and others, conviction of
the truth of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Miracles was based on <i>knowledge</i>,
and <i>experience of a matter of fact</i>: in the case of
Professor Powell, disbelief is founded on certain "antecedent
convictions" only: namely, "the inconceivableness
of imagined interruptions of natural Order,
or supposed suspensions of the Laws of matter." (p.
110.) He is never tired of repeating that "in an age
of physical research like the present, all highly cultivated
minds and duly advanced intellects&nbsp;(!) have
imbibed, more or less, the lessons of the Inductive
Philosophy; and have, at least in some measure,
learned to appreciate the grand foundation conception
of universal Law:" (p.&nbsp;133:) that "the entire range
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>of the Inductive Philosophy is at once based upon,
and in every instance tends to confirm, by immense
accumulation of evidence, the grand truth of the
universal Order and constancy of natural causes, as
a primary law of belief; so strongly entertained and
fixed in the mind of every truly inductive inquirer,
that he cannot even conceive the possibility of its
failure." (p.&nbsp;109.)</p>

<p>I gladly avail myself of a page from the writings
of a thoughtful writer of our own, who, half a century
ago, reviewed the very errors which are being so industriously
reproduced among ourselves at this day,&mdash;certainly
not with more ability than of old:&mdash;"Let us
examine a little farther into the weight of the argument
derived from the supposed immutability of the
Laws of Nature. It has constantly been the theme
of modern Unbelievers, that the course of Nature is
fixed, eternal, unalterable; and that nothing which
is supposed to violate it can possibly take place. Now,
we may readily allow, that the course of Nature is unalterable
by <i>human</i> power; nay, even by the power of
any <i>created</i> being whatsoever. But the question is,&mdash;Are
these Laws unalterable <i>by Him who made them</i>?
Proof of this is requisite, before the argument from the
immutability of the Laws of Nature can have the least
force. We may safely assert, however, that proof of
this is absolutely impossible.&mdash;'Facts,' it may be said,
'daily passing before us, warrant us in <i>supposing</i> its
laws to be unchangeable.' Perhaps so. But if a thousand
or more facts have occurred, since the Creation
of the World, in which those Laws appear to have
been over-ruled, or suspended, is such a conclusion
<i>then</i> warrantable? Even if there had never been
a single instance of a Miracle recorded, since the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>Creation; yet the conclusion would not be just or
logical, that no such thing is possible. But with such
a multiplicity of instances to the contrary as are
already on record, it is no better than a shameless
assertion, in direct opposition to the evidence of men's
senses and experience. Nay, more; the argument is
<i>atheistical</i>. For, either <span class="smcap">God</span> made and ordained these
Laws of Nature; and may, consequently, at His pleasure,
unmake or suspend them: or else, these laws
are self-framed, and Nature is independent of the <span class="smcap">God</span>
of Nature; which is saying, in other words, that the
material Universe is not governed by any Supreme
Intelligence.</p>

<p>"This latter opinion appears, indeed, to be the
tenet of all who resort to arguments of this kind, in
opposition to the credibility of Miracles. Thus it is
said, [by Hume,] that every effect must have a cause;
and that, therefore, a Miracle must have a cause in
<i>Nature</i>; otherwise, it cannot be effected.&mdash;But, is not
the <i>Will of</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>, without any other agency, or predisposing
cause, sufficient for the purpose? When
<span class="smcap">God</span> created the World out of nothing, what pre-existing
cause was there, except His own omnipotent
Will to produce the effect? Why then is not the
same Will sufficient to work Miracles?</p>

<p>"'But,' says another Sophist, [Spinoza,]&mdash;'<span class="smcap">God</span> is
the Author of the Laws of Nature; so that whatever
opposes those Laws, is necessarily <i>repugnant to the
Divine nature</i>: if, therefore, we believe that <span class="smcap">God</span> may
act in a manner contrary to those laws, we, in effect,
believe that He may do what is contrary to <i>His own
nature</i>; which is absurd and impossible.'</p>

<p>"The reasoning turns upon the supposition that
<span class="smcap">God</span> is actuated by an absolute <i>necessity</i> of His Nature,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>and not by his <i>Will</i>: or, rather, that He hath neither
Will, nor Intellect. Otherwise, it were easy to perceive,
that in suspending the operation of His own
Laws, <span class="smcap">God</span> cannot be charged with doing anything
contradictory to <i>His own</i> nature; since He may justly
be supposed to have as good reasons for <i>departing</i> from
those Laws, as for <i>framing</i> them: and as we know not
why He framed them in such a manner, and no otherwise;
so He may have the best and wisest reasons for
the suspension of them, which it is not for us to call in
question. To speak of the Supreme Being as actuated
by a kind of physical necessity, and not by His <i>Will</i>,
is to confound the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Nature with Nature itself;
which is the very essence of Atheism, and never can
be reconciled with any just notions of the Deity, as
a Being of intellectual and moral perfections<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>."</p>

<p><i>It is by no means inconceivable</i>, therefore, that the
great Cause of Creation, and first Author of Law
should interfere at any given time in the established
Order of Nature. Moreover, it is irrational, on sufficient
testimony, to disbelieve that He has sometimes
so interposed. To deny that this is conceivable, is to
make <span class="smcap">God</span> inferior to His own decree; to pronounce
it incredible that the Lawgiver should be superior
to His own Laws. "The universal subordination of
causation," (p.&nbsp;134,) we as freely admit as the Professor
himself: but then we contend that <i>everything
else</i> must be subordinate to the <i>First great Cause of all</i>.
Worse than unphilosophical is it to argue as the Professor
presumes to do, concerning the <span class="smcap">Most High</span>;
but unphilosophical in the strictest sense it is. For
it is to reason about Him, (the finite concerning the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>Infinite!) as if we understood Him; we, who can
barely decipher a little part of His works! A few
more remarks on this subject will be found in my
viith Sermon.</p>

<p>We are anxious to know if the whole of the case is
really before us. A few more extracts from Professor
Powell's Essay seem necessary to do full justice to his
view of the matter:&mdash;"All moral evidence must essentially
have respect to the parties to be convinced.
'Signs' might be adapted peculiarly <i>to the state of
moral or intellectual progress of one age</i>, or one class of
persons, and not be suited to that of others.... And it
is to the entire difference in the ideas, prepossessions,
modes, and grounds of belief in those times, that we
may trace the reason why Miracles, which would be
incredible <i>now</i>, were not so in the age, and under the
circumstances, in which they are stated to have occurred."
(p.&nbsp;117.) ... "An evidential appeal which in
a long past age was convincing, as made to <i>the state
of knowledge in that age</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, might have not only no effect,
but even an injurious tendency, if urged in the present,
and referring to what is at variance with existing
scientific conceptions; just as the arguments of the
present age would have been unintelligible to a former."</p>

<p>"In a period of advanced physical knowledge, the
reference to what was believed in past times, if at
variance with principles now acknowledged, could afford
little ground of appeal: in fact, would damage
the argument rather than assist it." (p.&nbsp;126.)</p>

<p>"It becomes imperatively necessary, that such views
should be suggested as may be really suitable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>better informed minds, and may meet the increasing
demands of an age pretending at least to greater enlightenment."
(p.&nbsp;126.)</p>

<p>There is nothing in the additional suggestions thus
thrown out which in reality affects the question at
issue. Certain antecedent considerations were before
insisted on, which (it was said) "must be paramount
to all attestation." (p.&nbsp;107.) These have been disposed
of. The writer now tells us that he does not
question "<i>the honesty</i> or <i>veracity</i> of the testimony,
or the reality of the <i>impressions</i> on the minds of the
witnesses." (p.&nbsp;106.) It remains to inquire therefore
to what natural causes, events which were once thought
miraculous, may reasonably be referred; since the so-called
Miracles of the imperfectly-informed age of our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> and His Apostles will not endure the scrutiny
of the present age of scientific enlightenment.</p>

<p>But this, unless it be a proposal to open the whole
question afresh,&mdash;to examine <i>the Miracles themselves</i>,&mdash;to
consider them one by one,&mdash;to inquire into their
exact nature,&mdash;and to investigate their attendant circumstances,&mdash;is
unmeaning. For we cannot, as reasonable
men, dismiss a vast body of august events, differing
so considerably one from another, with a vague
inuendo that there was probably "some kind of mistake
or deception somewhere, though we do not know
where:" (p.&nbsp;106:) a hint that natural events may have
been regarded as supernatural by an unscientific age,
(which I believe was Schleiermacher's view:) and so
forth. The two miraculous Draughts of fishes,&mdash;the
Stater found in the fish's mouth,&mdash;the stilling of the
Storm,&mdash;might perhaps, by a little rhetorical sophistry,
in unscrupulous hands, be so disposed of. But
the <i>Creative Power</i> displayed on the two occasions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>a miraculous feeding of thousands,&mdash;the giving of sight
to a man born blind,&mdash;the calling of Lazarus out
of the grave where he had been for four days buried;&mdash;these
are transactions which resist every attempt of
the enemy to explain away, as unscientific misconceptions.
They may be powerless to produce conviction
in some <i>now</i>, as they were powerless to produce
conviction in some <i>then</i>: but they cannot be set
aside by an insinuation. There could not have been
any mistake when the Five Thousand were fed with
five loaves, and twelve baskets full were gathered up;
or when the Four Thousand were fed with seven
loaves, and fragments enough to fill seven baskets
remained over<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. There was no room for deception in
the case of the man born blind; for <i>that</i> case immediately
underwent a judicial scrutiny<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Lazarus bound
hand and foot with grave-clothes required that the
bystanders should "loose him and let him go<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>:" but
from that moment, neither supposed scientific necessity,
nor antecedent considerations, nor the ordinary
course of Nature, nor any other creature, will avail to
bind him any more!</p>

<p>This may suffice on the subject of Professor Powell's
Essay. On the great question itself, I have said
something in my Seventh Sermon, to which the
reader is requested to refer.&mdash;The performance now
under consideration abounds in incorrect statements,
while it revives not a few exploded objections; but
I have considered the only points in it which are
material.</p>

<p>Thus the author assumes "that, unlike the <i>essential
Doctrines</i> of Christianity, 'the same yesterday, to-day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>and for ever,' those <i>external accessories</i>, [Miracles,
for example,] constitute a subject which of necessity
is perpetually taking somewhat at least of a new form,
with the successive phases of opinion and knowledge."
(p.&nbsp;94.) But, (waiving for the moment the impossibility
of severing the Doctrines of the Gospel from
the miraculous evidence that our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was a Teacher
sent from Heaven<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>), it requires no ability to perceive
that although "opinion" should alter daily, and
"knowledge" increase ever so much, yet, events professing
to be miraculous, being plain <i>matters of fact</i>,
are to-day exactly what and where they were many
centuries ago. Physical Science may pretend (with
Paulus) to explain them on natural principles, truly;
and while she does so, the world is sure to give her
a patient, even an indulgent hearing. But then she
must let it be known <i>what</i> she proposes to explain,
and <i>how</i> she proposes to explain it. She must be so
indulgent also, as to listen while we, in turn, shew
her <i>on what</i> grounds we find it impossible to accept
her Theory. "The inevitable progress of research,"
(says this author,) "must, within a longer or shorter
period, unravel <i>all that seems most marvellous</i>; and
what is at present least understood will become as
familiarly known to the Science of the future, as those
points which a few centuries ago, were involved in
equal obscurity, but are now thoroughly understood."
(p.&nbsp;109.) Such a vaticination as regards Miracles,
is, to say the least, premature; and until it can appeal
to incipient accomplishment, it must be regarded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>as nugatory also. I am not aware, that as yet one
single Miracle has been struck off the list; yet Miracles
have now been before the world a long time, and
they have not wanted enemies either.</p>

<p>To begin Divinity with a discussion of the "Evidences,"
we do indeed hold to be a beginning <i>at the
wrong end</i>. At the same time, all of Professor Powell's
opening remarks, in which he insinuates that the
Church would bar, or would stifle discussion concerning
the evidences of Religion, are obviously untrue.
No scrutiny of Christian Miracles, however rigid, is
stopped by the admonition that such narratives "ought
to be held sacred, and exempt from the unhallowed
criticism of human Reason." (p.&nbsp;110.) We do not,
by any means, "treat all objections as profane, and
discard exceptions unanswered as shocking and immoral."
(p.&nbsp;100.) Neither does the Church think
herself "omniscient and infallible;" (p.&nbsp;96;) though
she holds Omniscience to be an attribute of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and
Infallibility, of the Bible. But she deprecates in the
strongest manner vague insinuations and unsupported
doubts of the reality of her <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Miracles, sown
broad-cast over the land; and she is at a loss to
understand how the "difficulties" of any, can be in
this manner "removed;" (p.&nbsp;96;) except by a process
analogous to that which would cure a malady by
taking away the life of the patient. We are not in fact
at all disposed to admit that "Miracles, which in
the estimation of a former age were among the chief
<i>supports</i> of Christianity, are at present among the
main <i>difficulties</i>, and hindrances to its acceptance,"
(p.&nbsp;140,)&mdash;although Professor Powell and Dr. Temple
say so.</p>

<p>This Essay in fact is full of incorrect, or objection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>able
statements. Thus Professor Powell asserts that
since "evidential arguments are avowedly addressed to
the intellect, it is especially preposterous to shift the
ground, and charge the rejection of them on <i>moral</i>
motives." (p.&nbsp;100.) And yet it is worthy of notice
that our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself assures us that the reception
of Truth depends on our moral, rather than on our
intellectual condition. "How can ye believe," (He
said to the Jews,) "which receive honour one of
another, and seek not the honour that cometh from
<span class="smcap">God</span> only<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>?"</p>

<p>This writer reasons also with singular laxity and
inaccuracy. After quoting the dictum that "on a
certain amount of testimony we might believe any
statement, however improbable," (pp.&nbsp;140-1,) he scornfully
adds;&mdash;"So that if a number of respectable witnesses
were to concur in asseverating that on a certain
occasion they had seen two and two make five, we
should be bound to believe them!" (p.&nbsp;141.) Does
he fail to perceive, (1)&nbsp;that mathematical truths do
not come within the province of probable reasoning,
and (2)&nbsp;are not dependent on testimony?... Again,
"The case of the <i>antecedent</i> argument of Miracles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span>is very clear, however little some are inclined to perceive
it. In Nature and from Nature, by Science and
by Reason, <i>we neither have nor can possibly have any
evidence of a Deity working by Miracles</i>;&mdash;for that, we
must go out of Nature, and beyond Science." (pp.
141-2.) Very true. We must go <i>to Scripture</i>. We
must have recourse to testimony. This is precisely
what we are maintaining.... But,&mdash;"Testimony,
after all, is but a second-hand assurance; it is but
a blind guide; testimony can avail nothing against
Reason." (p.&nbsp;141.) True. But this, if it is intended
as an argument against the reasonableness of admitting
the truth of Miracles, is a mere <i>petitio principii</i>.... Again.
"It is not the <i>mere fact</i> but the <i>cause</i>
or <i>explanation</i> of it, which is the point at issue." (p.
141.) Admitting then, as the learned author here
does, that when <span class="smcap">Christ</span> said "Lazarus, come forth,"
"he that was dead," (though he had been buried four
days,) "came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>;"&mdash;admitting
these "facts," I say,&mdash;what
other "cause," or "explanation" does the reverend
gentleman propose to assign but the supernatural power
of the Divine Speaker?</p>

<p>Far graver exception, however, must be taken
against certain parts of Professor Powell's labours,
which betray an animus fatally indicative of the tendency
of such Essays and Reviews as these. Witness
his assertion that "it is now acknowledged that
'Creation' is only another name for our ignorance
of the mode of production;" (p.&nbsp;139;) and that a recent
work on the Origin of Species "substantiates on
undeniable grounds the very principle so long denounced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>by the first naturalists,&mdash;<i>the origination of
new species by natural causes</i>;" (p.&nbsp;139;) and that the
said work "must soon bring about an entire revolution
of opinion in favour of the grand principle of
the <i>self-evolving powers of Nature</i>." (p.&nbsp;139.)</p>

<p>One object of the present Essay is to insist that
since Miracles belong to the world of matter, "we
must recognize the due claims of Science to decide"
upon them. We are reminded that "beyond the domain
of physical causation and the possible conceptions
of <i>intellect</i> or <i>knowledge</i>, there lies open the boundless
region of spiritual things, which is the sole dominion
of Faith:" (p.&nbsp;127:) and that "Advancing knowledge,
while it asserts the dominion of Science in physical
things, confirms that of Faith in spiritual." (p.&nbsp;127.)
It is proposed that "we thus neither impugn the generalizations
of Philosophy, nor allow them to invade
the dominion of Faith; and admit that what is not a
subject for a problem, may hold its place in a Creed."
(p.&nbsp;127.)</p>

<p>But the fatal consequences of this plausible fallacy
become apparent the instant we turn the leaf, and
read that "the more knowledge advances, the more
it has been, and will be acknowledged, that Christianity,
as a real religion, must be viewed apart from
connexion with physical things." (p.&nbsp;128.) That "the
first dissociation of the spiritual from the physical
was rendered necessary by the palpable contradictions
disclosed by astronomical discovery with the letter
of Scripture. Another still wider and more material
step has been effected by the discoveries of Geology.
More recently, the antiquity of the Human Race, and
the development of Species, and <i>the rejection of the
idea of 'Creation'</i>&nbsp;(!) have caused new advances in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>same direction." (p.&nbsp;129.) ... From this it is evident,
not only that the object of Science in thus taking the
Miracles of Scripture into her own keeping, is (like
an unnatural step-dame) to slay them; but that downright
Atheism is to be the attitude in which men
are expected to survey that "boundless region of spiritual
things" which is yet proclaimed to be "the sole
dominion of Faith!"</p>

<p>Faith, on the other hand, does not object to the
constant visits of Science to any part of <i>her</i> treasure.
She does but insist that all discussion shall be conducted
<i>according to the rules of right Reason</i>. Vague
insinuations about "a progressing Age," (p.&nbsp;131,)&mdash;"new
modes of speculation," (p.&nbsp;130,)&mdash;"the advance
of Opinion," (p.&nbsp;131,)&mdash;and so forth, are as little to
the purpose, <i>apart from specific objections</i>, as sneers at
"the one-sided dogmas of an obsolete school, coupled
with awful denunciations of heterodoxy on all who
refuse to listen to them," (p.&nbsp;131,) are unsuited to
the gravity of the occasion. Faith insists moreover
that a divorce between the miraculous parts of Scripture,
and the context wherein they stand, is simply
impossible. The unbeliever who boldly says, "I disbelieve
the Bible,"&mdash;however much we may deplore
his blindness and pity his misery,&mdash;is yet intelligible
in his unbelief. But the man who proposes to believe
<i>the narrative</i> of the Exode of Israel from Egypt, (for
instance,) apart from the supernatural character of the
events which are related to have attended it; who
believes <i>the history</i> of the Gospels, (holding the Evangelists
to have been veracious writers,) yet rejects the
Divine nature of the Miracles which the Gospels relate;
and proposes, after eliminating from the historical
narrative everything which claims to be miraculous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>to make what remains of that historical narrative, the
strength and stay of his soul in life and in death:&mdash;<i>that</i>
man we boldly affirm to be one who cannot have
studied the Bible with that ordinary attention which
would entitle him to dogmatize concerning its contents:
or else, whose logical faculty must be so hopelessly
defective that discussions of this class are evidently
not his proper province.</p>

<p>Finally, we are presented in this Essay with the
same offensive assumption of intellectual superiority
on the part of the writer, which disfigures the entire
volume. "It becomes <i>imperatively necessary</i> that views
should be suggested really suitable <i>to better informed
minds</i>." (p.&nbsp;126.) "Points which may be seen to involve
the greatest difficulty to <i>more profound inquirers</i>,
are often such as do not occasion the least perplexity
to <i>ordinary minds</i>, but are allowed to pass without
hesitation." (p.&nbsp;125.) (And this, from one of those
"profound inquirers," one of "those who have reflected
most deeply," (p.&nbsp;126,) who yet cannot get
beyond a resuscitation of Hume and Spinoza's exploded
objections to the truth of Miracles!)&mdash;Butler's
unanswerable arguments, (for the allusion is evidently
to <i>him</i>,) are spoken of as "a few trite and commonplace
generalities as to the moral government of the
World and the belief in the Divine Omnipotence; or
as to the validity of human testimony; or the limits
of human experience." (p.&nbsp;133.) And yet the author
is for ever informing us that his hostility to Miracles
"is essentially built upon those <i>grander conceptions</i> of
the order of Nature, those comprehensive primary elements
of all physical knowledge, those ultimate ideas
of universal causation, which can only be familiar to
<i>those thoroughly versed in cosmical philosophy in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>widest sense</i>." (p.&nbsp;133.) "All <i>highly cultivated minds</i>,
and <i>duly advanced intellects</i>," are supposed to find
their exponent in Professor Baden Powell. All other
thinkers have "<i>minds of a less comprehensive capacity</i>,"
"accustomed to reason on <i>more contracted views</i>."
(p.&nbsp;133. See also p.&nbsp;131, <i>top</i>.) Is this the modesty
of real Science? the language of a true Philosopher
and Divine?</p>

<p>Finally, after all that has gone before we are not
much astonished, but we <i>are</i> considerably shocked,
to read as follows:&mdash;"The Divine Omnipotence is
entirely an inference <i>from the language of the Bible</i>,
adopted <i>on the assumption</i> of a belief in Revelation.
That 'with <span class="smcap">God</span> nothing is impossible' is the very
declaration of Scripture; yet on this, the whole belief
in Miracles is built<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>." Now, it happens that 'the
whole belief in Miracles' is built on nothing of the
kind: but the point is immaterial. By no means immaterial,
however, is the intimation that the Divine
attribute of Omnipotence is a mere inference from the
language of Revelation,&mdash;the very belief in which is
also a mere "assumption." <i>If belief in Holy Scripture</i>
is to be treated as <i>an assumption</i>,&mdash;without at all complaining
of the unreasonableness of one who so speaks,&mdash;we
yet desire that he would say it very plainly;
and let us know at least <i>with whom</i> we have to do,
and <i>what</i> we are expected to prove. We do not complain,
if any one calls upon us to shew that a belief
in the Bible cannot be called an assumption; but it
makes us very sad: and when the challenge comes
from a Minister of the Church, we are unable to forbear
the remark that there is something altogether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>immoral<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> in the entire proceeding. On the other hand,
to find ourselves involved in an argument on questions
of Divinity with one <i>who believes nothing</i>, is in a manner
absurd; and provokes a feeling of resentment as
well as of pity.... What need to add that life is not
long enough for such processes of proof? "He that
cometh unto <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>must believe that He is</i>!" We cannot
be for ever laying the foundation. The building
must begin, at last, to grow. And when it <i>has</i> grown
up, and is compact as well as beautiful, it <i>cannot</i> be
necessary to pull it all down again once or twice in
every century in order to ascertain whether the strong
foundations be still there!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>IV. The next performance is mainly directed against
faith in the Church, as a society of Divine origin.
"The Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry Bristow Wilson</span>, B.D., Vicar of
Great Staughton, Hunts," claims that a National
Church shall be regarded as a purely secular Institution,&mdash;the
spontaneous development of the State.
"If all priests and ministers of religion could at one
moment be swept from the face of the Earth, they
would soon be reproduced<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>." The Church is concerned
with Ethics, not with Divinity. It should
therefore be "free from dogmatic tests, and similar
intellectual bondage:" (p.&nbsp;168:) hampered by no
traditional Doctrines; pledged to no Creeds: but, on
the contrary, should be subject to periodical doctrinal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span>re-adjustments. "Doctrinal limitations" (i.e. the
Creeds) "are not essential to" the Church. "Upon
larger knowledge of Christian history, upon a more
thorough acquaintance with the mental constitution
of man, upon an understanding of the obstacles they
present to a true Catholicity&nbsp;(!), they may be cast off."
(p.&nbsp;167.) "In order to the possibility of recruiting
any national Ministry from the whole of the nation, ...
no needless intellectual or speculative obstacles
should be interposed." (p.&nbsp;196. So at p.&nbsp;198.)</p>

<p>To all this, the answer is very obvious. Viewed as
an historical fact, the Church is <i>not</i> of human origin.
The Church <i>is</i> a Divine Institution. That a Priest of
the Church, charged with a cure of souls, should desire
her annihilation,&mdash;the reversal of the facts of her
past History,&mdash;her reconstruction on an unheard-of
basis, without even Creeds as terms of communion
with her,&mdash;and so forth; all this may suggest some
very painful doubts as <i>to the objector's honesty</i> in continuing
to employ the formularies of that Church, and
in professing to teach her doctrines;&mdash;but it can
hardly be supposed to have any effect whatever on
the question at issue.</p>

<p>Foreseeing this, Mr. Wilson begins by asserting,&mdash;(for
to insinuate is not for so advanced a disciple of
"the negative Theology,") (p.&nbsp;151,)&mdash;"the fact of
a very wide-spread alienation, both of educated and
uneducated persons, from the Christianity which is
ordinarily presented in our Churches and Chapels."
(p.&nbsp;150.) "A self-satisfied Sacerdotalism, confident
in a supernaturally transmitted illumination," may
amuse itself in trying to "keep peace within the
walls of emptied Churches:" (p.&nbsp;150:) but the day
for "traditional Christianity" (p.&nbsp;149.) has gone by.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>We may no longer ignore "a great extent of dissatisfaction
on the part of the Clergy at some portion,
at least, of formularies of the Church of England,"&mdash;especially
at the use of "one unhappy creed."
(p.&nbsp;150.) There has been "a spontaneous recoil"
from some of the old doctrines: a distrust of the old
arguments: and a misgiving concerning Scripture
itself. "In the presence of difficulties of this kind,
... it is vain to seek to check open discussion."
(p.&nbsp;151.)</p>

<p>Why then does not this man proceed openly to
discuss? is the obvious rejoinder. Instead of vaguely
hinting that either the Reason or the Moral sense is
shocked by what people hear "in our Churches and
Chapels,"&mdash;why has not this writer, first, the honesty
to withdraw from the Ministry of the Church of England;
and next, the courage to indicate the particular
doctrines which offend? To say that "the ordinances
of public worship and religious instruction provided
for the people of England" are not "really adapted to
the wants of their nature as it is," (p.&nbsp;150,) is a very
vague and unworthy style of urging an objection.
Why does not the reverend writer explain <i>wherein</i> the
Doctrine and Discipline of the English Church are not
really adapted to the actual wants of Man's nature?</p>

<p>Let every unbeliever however be allowed to state
his difficulties in his own way. Mr. Wilson's difficulties
certainly take a very peculiar shape. The
increased <i>Geographical</i> knowledge of the present generation
has evidently disturbed his faith. "In our
own boyhood, the World as known to the ancients
was nearly all which was known to ourselves&nbsp;(!). We
have recently become acquainted,&mdash;intimate,&mdash;with
the teeming regions of the far East, and with empires,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>pagan or even atheistic, of which the origin runs far
back beyond the historic records of Jud&aelig;a or of the
West, and which were more populous than all Christendom
now is, for many ages before the Christian era."
(p.&nbsp;162.) Such a statement is soon made; but it
ought to have been substantiated. I take the liberty
of doubting its accuracy.</p>

<p>But granting even that the heathen world "for
many ages before the Christian era" <i>was</i> more populous
than all Christendom now is:&mdash;what then?
This fact "<i>suggests questions</i> to those who on Sundays
hear the reading and exposition of the Scriptures as
they were expounded to our forefathers, and on Monday
peruse the news of a World of which our forefathers
little dreamed." (pp.&nbsp;152-3.)&mdash;And pray, (we
calmly inquire,) <i>Why</i> are the Scriptures to be read or
expounded after a novel fashion, even though our
geographical knowledge <i>has</i> made a considerable advance?
To this, we are favoured with no answer.
The "questions" suggested are, we presume, the same
which are contained in the following sentence. "In
what relation does the Gospel stand to these millions<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>?
Is there any trace on the face of its records that it
even contemplated their existence<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>? We are told,
that to know and believe in <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> is in some
sense necessary to Salvation. It has not been given
to these. Are they,&mdash;will they be, hereafter,&mdash;the
worse off for their ignorance?" (p.&nbsp;153.) ... "As to
the necessity of faith in a <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> to these peoples
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a></span>when they could never have had it, no one, upon
reflection, can believe in any such thing. Doubtless
they will be equitably dealt with." (p.&nbsp;153.)</p>

<p>These last seven words, (which scarcely seem of
a piece with the rest of the sentence,) we confess have
always seemed a sufficient answer to the badly-expressed
speculative difficulty which immediately
precedes; a difficulty, be it observed, which does
not depend <i>at all</i> on the popular advancement of
Geographical knowledge; for it was urged with the
self-same force anciently, as now; and was met by
Bp. Butler, almost in the self-same words<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, upwards
of a hundred years ago. But Mr. Wilson to our
surprise and sorrow proceeds:&mdash;"We cannot be content
to wrap this question up and leave it for a mystery,
as to what shall become of those myriads upon
myriads of non-Christian races. First, if our traditions
tell us, that they are involved in the curse and
perdition of Adam, and may justly be punished hereafter
individually for his transgression, not having
been extricated from it by saving faith,&mdash;we are disposed
to think that our traditions cannot herein fairly
declare to us the words and inferences from Scripture;
but if on examination it should turn out that they
have,&mdash;we must say, that the authors of the Scriptural
books have, in those matters, represented to us their
own inadequate conceptions, and not the mind of the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>." (pp.&nbsp;153-4.)</p>

<p>I forbear to dwell upon the grievous spectacle with
which we are thus presented. Here is a Clergyman
of the Church of England deliberately proposing the
following dilemma:&mdash;Either the Prayer Book is incorrect
in its most important doctrinal inferences from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span>Holy Scripture; or else, the Authors of Holy Scripture
itself are incorrect in their statements. The
morality of one who declares that he finds himself
placed between the horns of this dilemma, and yet
retains his office as a public teacher in the Church of
England,&mdash;it is painful to contemplate. But this is
only <i>ad hominem</i>. The Reverend writer's difficulty
remains.</p>

<p>And it seems sufficient to reply:&mdash;It is not <i>we</i> who
"wrap up the question," but <span class="smcap">God</span>. As a mystery we
find it; and as a mystery, we not only "can," but <i>must</i>
be content to "leave it." Further, it is not "<i>our traditions</i>,"
but Holy Scripture itself which tells us that
"by one man Sin entered into the World, and Death
by Sin; and so Death passed upon all men, for that
all have sinned<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>:"&mdash;that "in Adam all died<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>:"&mdash;that
"we were by nature the children of wrath, even as
others<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>:" and the like. Scripture, on the other hand,
as unequivocally assures us that <span class="smcap">God</span> is good, or rather
that He is very Goodness. We are convinced, (in
Mr. Wilson's words,) "that all shall be equitably
dealt with according to their opportunities." (p.&nbsp;154.)
Moreover, <i>he</i> would be a rash Divine who should venture
to adopt the opinion so strenuously disclaimed by
Bp. Butler, "that none can have the benefit of the
general Redemption, but such as have the advantage
of being made acquainted with it in the present life<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>."
... How, in the meantime, speculative difficulties concerning
the hereafter of the unevangelized Heathen are
affected by the fact that our population now "peruse
the news of a World of which our forefathers little
dreamed," (pp.&nbsp;152-3,)&mdash;it is hard to see. Equally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[lxx]</a></span>unable am I also to understand how the discovery
that a larger number of persons are the subjects of
this speculative difficulty than used once to be supposed,
can constitute any reason why Scripture should
not still be read and expounded on Sunday "as it
used to be expounded to our forefathers."</p>

<p>We have been so particular, because whenever any
of these writers condescend to be argumentative, <i>we</i>
are eager to bear them company. No wish at all
have we, in the abstract, to stifle inquiry; no objection
whatever have we to the principle of free discussion.
And yet, as a clergyman, I cannot discuss
such questions as these with a <i>Minister of the Church
of England</i>, except under protest. I deny that these
are in any sense open questions. To dispute concerning
them,&mdash;&#949;&#7984; &#956;&#8052; &#952;&#8051;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#965;&#955;&#8049;&#964;&#964;&#969;&#957;,&mdash;one of the
disputants must first, at least, resign his commission.
It is simply dishonest in a man to hold a commission
in the Church of England, under solemn vows, and
yet to deny her doctrines. An Officer in the Army
who should pursue a similar line of action, would be
dismissed the Service,&mdash;or worse.&mdash;Under protest,
then, we follow the Rev. H.&nbsp;B. Wilson, B.D.</p>

<p>Next come three other specimens "of the modern
questionings of traditional Christianity," "whereby
observers are rendered dissatisfied with old modes
of speaking:" (p.&nbsp;156:) viz. (1)&nbsp;St. Paul "speaks of
the Gospel 'which was preached to every nation (<i>sic</i>)
under heaven,' when it has never yet been preached
to the half<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>." (2)&nbsp;"Then, again, it has often been
appealed to as an evidence of the supernatural origin
of Christianity, and as an instance of supernatural
assistance vouchsafed to it in the first centuries, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[lxxi]</a></span>it so soon overspread the world:" (p.&nbsp;155:) whereas "it
requires no learning to be aware that neither then
nor subsequently have the Christians amounted to a
fourth part of the people of the Earth." (<i>Ibid.</i>) (3)
So again, "it has been customary to argue that,
<i>&agrave; priori</i>, a supernatural Revelation was to be expected
at the time when <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> was manifested upon
the Earth, by reason of the exhaustion of all natural
or unassisted human efforts for the amelioration of
mankind;" (pp.&nbsp;155-6;) whereas "our recently enlarged
Ethnographical information shews such an
argument to be altogether inapplicable to the case."
"It would be more like the realities of things, as we
can now behold them, to say that the Christian Revelation
was given to the Western World, because it deserved
it better and was more prepared for it than the
East." (p.&nbsp;156.)&mdash;The remedy for the first of these
difficulties (says Mr. Wilson,) is, "candidly to acknowledge
that the words of the New Testament which
speak of the preaching of the Gospel to the whole
world, were limited to the understanding of the times
when they were spoken." The suggestions of our own
moral instincts are rather to be followed, "than the
express declarations of Scripture writers, who had no
such knowledge as is given to ourselves of the amplitude
of the World." (p.&nbsp;157.)</p>

<p>For my own part, I see not how Mr. Wilson's proposed
remedy meets the case; unless he means to say
that in the time of St. Paul the Gospel had been
literally preached to the whole World <i>as far as the
World was then known</i>. If not, it is clear that recourse
must be had to some other expedient. Instead
then of the "candid acknowledgment" required of <i>us</i>
by the learned writer, may we be allowed to suggest
to <i>him</i> the more prosaic expedient (1st) of making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a></span>sure that he quotes Scripture accurately; and (2nd)
that he understands it?... It happens that St. Paul
does not use the words "<i>every nation under heaven</i>"
as Mr. Wilson inadvertently supposes. The Apostle's
phrase, &#960;&#8049;&#963;&#8131; &#964;&#8135; &#954;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#949;&#953;, in Colossians i. 23, (as in St.
Mark xvi. 15), means 'to the whole Creation,' or
'every creature;' (the article is doubtful;) in other
words, he announces the universality of the Gospel,
as contrasted with the Law; and he explains that it
had been preached <i>to the Heathen</i> as well as to the
Jews. Our increased knowledge therefore has nothing
whatever to do with the question; and the supposed
difficulty disappears. The two which remain,
being (according to the same writer,) merely incorrect
inferences of Biblical critics, need not, it is presumed,
be regarded as insurmountable either.</p>

<p>Following Mr. Wilson through his successive vagaries
of religious (?) thought, we come upon a succession
of strange statements; the object of which
seems to be to cast a slur on <i>Doctrine</i> generally.&mdash;The
doctrine of Justification by faith "is not met
with ... in the Apostolic writings, <i>except those of St.
Paul</i>." (p.&nbsp;160.) [A minute exception truly!].&mdash;"Then,
on the other hand, it is maintained by a large body
of Theologians, as by the learned Jesuit Petavius and
many others, that the doctrine afterwards developed
into the Nicene and Athanasian, is not to be found
explicitly in the earliest fathers, nor even in Scripture,
although provable by it." (p.&nbsp;160.) [Would it not
have been fair, however, to state what appears to have
been the design of Petavius therein<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>? and should it
not have been added that our own Bishop Bull in his immortal
"Defensio Fidei Nic&aelig;n&aelig;" established the very
reverse "out of the writings of the Catholic Doctors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span>who flourished within the first three centuries of the
Christian Church<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>?"] "The nearer we come to the
original sources of the History, the less definite do we
find the statements of Doctrines, and even of the facts
from which the Doctrines were afterwards inferred."
(p.&nbsp;160.) "In the patristic writings, theoretics assume
continually an increasingly disproportionate value.
Even within the compass of our New Testament, there
is to be found already a wonderful contrast between
the words of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and such a discourse as the
Epistle to the Hebrews." (pp.&nbsp;160-1.) [What a curious
discovery, by the way, that an argumentative
Epistle should differ in style from an historical Gospel!]
"Our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Discourses," (continues this
writer,) "have almost all of them a direct <i>Moral</i>
bearing." (p.&nbsp;161.) [The case of St. John's Gospel
immediately recurs to our memory. And it seems to
have occurred to Mr. Wilson's also. He says:&mdash;]
"This character of His words is certainly more obvious
in the first three Gospels than in the fourth;
and the remarkable unison of those Gospels, when
they recite the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> words, notwithstanding their
discrepancies in some matters of fact, compels us to
think, that <i>they embody more exact traditions of what
He actually said than the fourth does</i>." (p.&nbsp;161.) [In
other words, the authenticity of St. John's Gospel<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[lxxiv]</a></span>to be suspected rather than the worthlessness of the
speculations of the Vicar of Great Staughton!]</p>

<p>The object of three pages which follow (pp.&nbsp;162-5.)
seems to be to shew that in the Apostolic Age, Immorality
of life was more severely dealt with, even
than erroneousness of Doctrine. Except because the
writer is eager to depreciate the value of orthodoxy
of belief, and to cast a slur on doctrinal standards
generally,&mdash;it is hard to see why he should write
thus. Let him be reminded however that our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
makes Faith itself a <i>moral</i>, not an <i>intellectual</i> habit<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>;
and, (if it be not an uncivil remark,) what but an
<i>immoral</i> spectacle does a Clergyman present who
openly inculcates distrust of these very Doctrines
which he has in the most solemn manner pledged
himself to uphold and maintain?</p>

<p>And thus we come back to the theme originally
proposed. "A national Church," we are informed,
"need not, historically speaking, be Christian&nbsp;(!);
nor, if it be Christian, need it be tied down to particular
forms which have been prevalent at certain
times in Christendom&nbsp;(!). That which is essential to
a National Church is, that it should undertake to assist
the spiritual progress of the nation and of the
individuals of which it is composed, in their several
states and stages. Not even a Christian Church
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[lxxv]</a></span>should expect all those who are brought under its
influence to be, as a matter of fact, of one and the
same standard; but should endeavour to raise each
according to his capacities, and should give no occasion
for a reaction against itself, nor provoke the individualist
element into separation." (p.&nbsp;173.) Of what
sort the Ministers of such a "chartered libertine" are
to prove, may be anticipated. "Thought and speech,
which are free among all other classes," must be free
also "among those who hold the office of leaders and
teachers of the rest in the highest things." The
Ministers of the Church ought not "to be bound to
cover up, but to open; and having, it is presumed,
possession of the key of knowledge, ought not to stand
at the door with it, permitting no one to enter unless
by force. A National Church may also find itself in
this position, which, perhaps, is our own." (p.&nbsp;174.)&mdash;What
a charming picture of the duties and the method
of that class to which the Vicar of Great Staughton
himself belongs!... The writer proceeds to set an
example of that freedom of inquiry which he vindicates
as the privilege of his Order; and without which
he is apprehensive of being left isolated between "the
fanatical religionist," (p.&nbsp;174,) (i.e. the man who believes
the truths he teaches,) and "the negative theologian,"
(i.e. those who, "impatient of old fetters,
follow free thought heedlessly wherever it may lead
them.") (<i>Ibid.</i>) "The freedom of opinion<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>," (he says,)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[lxxvi]</a></span>"which belongs to the English citizen should be conceded
to the English Churchman; and the freedom
which is already practically enjoyed by the members
of the congregation, cannot without injustice be denied
to its ministers." (p.&nbsp;180.) Let us see how the Reverend
Gentleman exercises the license which he
claims:&mdash;</p>

<p>The phrase "Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>," (he says,) is unauthorized
and begs the question. The epithet "Canonical"
"may mean either books ruled and determined
by the Church, or regulation books; and the employment
of it in the Article hesitates between these two
significations." (p.&nbsp;176.) The declaration of the sixth
Article simply implies "the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span> is contained
in Scripture; whence it does not follow that it is co-extensive
with it." (p.&nbsp;170.) "Under the terms of the
Sixth Article one may accept literally, or allegorically,
or as parable, or poetry, or legend, the story of a
serpent-tempter, of an ass speaking with man's voice,
of an arresting the earth's motion, of a reversal of its
motion<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, of waters standing in a solid heap, of witches,
and a variety of apparitions. So under the terms of
the Sixth Article, every one is free in judgment as to
the primeval institution of the Sabbath, the universality
of the Deluge, the confusion of tongues, the
corporeal taking up of Elijah into Heaven, the nature
of Angels, the reality of demoniacal possession, the
personality of Satan, and the miraculous particulars of
many events." (p.&nbsp;177.) "Good men," we are assured;
(the Inspired Writers being the good men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[lxxvii]</a></span>intended;) "may err in facts, be weak in memory,
mingle imaginations with memory, be feeble in inferences,
confound illustration with argument, be varying
in judgment and opinion." (p.&nbsp;179.) [A "free
handling" this, of the work of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, truly!...
It would, I suppose, be deemed very unreasonable
to wish that a catalogue of facts misstated,&mdash;of
slips of memory,&mdash;of imaginary details,&mdash;of feeble inferences,&mdash;of
instances of logical confusion,&mdash;and so
forth, had been subjoined by the Reverend writer.
I will only observe concerning his method that such
"frank criticism of Scripture" (p.&nbsp;174.) as this, is
dogmatism of the most disreputable kind: insinuating
what it does not state; assuming what it ought to
prove; asserting in the general what it may be defied
to substantiate in particular.] It follows,&mdash;"But the
spirit of absolute Truth cannot err or contradict Himself;
if He speak immediately, even in small things,
accessories, or accidents." (p.&nbsp;179.) To this we entirely
agree. Where then are the "errors?" and
where the "contradictions?"</p>

<p>We cannot "suppose Him to suggest contradictory
accounts:" [not <i>contradictory</i>, of course; because contradictories
cannot both be true:] "or accounts only
to be reconciled in the way of hypothesis and conjecture."&mdash;(<i>Ibid.</i>)
<i>Why</i> not<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>?</p>

<p>"To suppose a supernatural influence to cause the
record of that which can only issue in a puzzle, is to
lower indefinitely our conception of the Divine dealings
in respect of a special Revelation." (<i>Ibid.</i>)&mdash;<i>Why</i>
more of a lowering puzzle in <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word than
in <span class="smcap">God's</span> Works<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>?</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson proceeds:&mdash;"It may be attributed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[lxxviii]</a></span>the defect of our understandings, that we should be
<i>unable altogether to reconcile the aspects</i> of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
as presented to us in the first three Gospels, and in
the writings of St. Paul and St. John. At any rate,
there were current in the primitive Church very distinct
Christologies."&mdash;(<i>Ibid.</i>) Queer language this
for a plain man! <i>I</i>, for my own part, have never
yet discovered the difficulty which is here hinted at;
but which has been prudently left unexplained.</p>

<p>It follows:&mdash;"But neither to any defect in our
capacities, nor to any reasonable presumption of a
hidden wise design, nor to any partial spiritual endowments
in the narrators, can we attribute the difficulty,
if not impossibility, of reconciling the genealogies
of St. Matthew and St. Luke; or the chronology
of the Holy Week; or the accounts of the
Resurrection: nor to any mystery in the subject-matter
can be referred the uncertainty in which the
New Testament writings leave us, as to the descent
of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> according to the flesh, whether by
His mother He were of the tribe of Judah or of the
tribe of Levi."&mdash;(pp.&nbsp;179-180.) I, for my part, can
declare that I have found the reconcilement in the
three subjects first alluded to, as complete as could
be either expected or desired. The last part of the
sentence discovers nothing so much as the writer's
ignorance of the subject on which he presumes to
dogmatize.</p>

<p>Presently, we read,&mdash;"It may be worth while to
consider how far a liberty of opinion is conceded by
our existing Laws, Civil and Ecclesiastical."&mdash;(p.&nbsp;180.)
"As far as <i>opinion privately entertained is concerned</i>,
the liberty of the English Clergyman appears already
to be complete. For no Ecclesiastical person can be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[lxxix]</a></span>obliged to answer interrogations as to his opinions;
nor be troubled for that which he has not actually
expressed; nor be made responsible for inferences
which other people may draw from his expressions."
(<i>Ibid.</i>)&mdash;Surely such language needs only to be
cited to awaken indignation in every honest bosom!
"With most men educated, not in the schools of
Jesuitism, but in the sound and honest moral training
of an English Education, the mere entering on
the record such a plea as this, must destroy the whole
case. If the position of the religious instructor is to
be maintained only by his holding one thing as true,
and teaching another thing as to be received,&mdash;in the
name of the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Truth, either let all teaching
cease, or let the fraudulent instructor abdicate willingly
his office, before the moral indignation of an
as yet uncorrupted people thrust him ignominiously
from his abused seat<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>!"</p>

<p>The remarks just quoted serve to introduce a series
of views on subscription to the Articles, which, if
they were presented to me without any intimation
of the quarter from which they proceed, I should not
have hesitated to denounce as simply dishonest<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>....
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[lxxx]</a></span>The Statute 13 Eliz. c. 12, is next discussed with the
same unhappy licentiousness; and the declaration that
"the meshes are too open for modern refinements."
(p.&nbsp;185.) ... I desire not to speak with undue severity
of a fellow-creature: but I protest that I cannot
read the Review under consideration without a profound
conviction that, (speaking for myself,) I have
to do with one whom in the common concerns of life
I would not trust. The aptitude here displayed<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> for
playing tricks with plain language, is calculated to
sap the foundations of human intercourse, and to destroy
confidence. If plain words may mean anything,
or may mean nothing,&mdash;then, farewell to all good
faith in the intercourse of daily life. If Articles "for
the avoiding of Diversities of Opinions, and for the
establishing of Consent touching true Religion<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>,"&mdash;such
Articles especially as the IInd., "Of the <span class="smcap">Word</span>
or <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, which was made very Man;" and the
Vth., "Of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>," (which the Rev. Mr.
Wilson calls "humanifying of the Divine Word,"
and "the Divine Personalities,") (p.&nbsp;186,)&mdash;may be
signed by one who, even in signing, resolves to "<i>pass
by the side of them</i>," (p.&nbsp;186, line 6,)&mdash;then is it better
at once to admit that no Logic can be supposed to be
available with such a writer; that he places himself
outside the reach of fair argumentation; and must
not be astonished if he shall find himself regarded by
his peers simply in the light of an untrustworthy and
impracticable person.</p>

<p>The last stage of all in this deplorable paper is an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[lxxxi]</a></span>application to Holy Scripture itself of the tricks which
the Vicar of Great Staughton has already played, so
much to his own satisfaction, with the Articles. "We
may say that the value of the historical parts of the
Bible may consist, rather in their significance, in the
ideas which they awaken, than in the scenes themselves
which they depict." (p.&nbsp;199.) To a plain English
understanding, (unperplexed with the dreams of
Strauss, and other unbelievers of the same stamp,)
such a statement conveys scarcely an intelligible notion.
But we are not left long in doubt.</p>

<p>"The application of Ideology to the interpretation
of Scripture, to the doctrines of Christianity, to the
formularies of the Church, may undoubtedly be carried
to an excess; may be pushed so far as to leave
in the sacred records no historical residue whatever....
An example of the critical Ideology carried to
excess, is that of Strauss; which resolves into an
ideal <i>the whole of the historical and doctrinal person
of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span></i>.... But it by no means follows, because
Strauss has substituted a mere shadow for the <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
of the Evangelists, that there are not traits in the
scriptural person of Jesus, which are better explained
by referring them to an ideal than an historical origin:
and without falling into fanciful exegetics, there are
parts of Scripture more usefully interpreted ideologically
than in any other manner,&mdash;as for instance,
<i>the history of the Temptation of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> by Satan, and
accounts of demoniacal possessions</i>." (pp.&nbsp;200-201.)
"Some may consider the descent of all Mankind from
Adam and Eve as an undoubted historical fact; others
may rather perceive in that relation a form of narrative
into which in early ages tradition would easily
throw itself spontaneously.... <i>Among a particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[lxxxii]</a></span>people, this historical representation became the concrete
expression of a great moral truth</i>,&mdash;of the brotherhood
of all human beings.... The force, grandeur, and
reality of these ideas are not a whit impaired in the
abstract, nor indeed the truth of the concrete history&nbsp;(!)
as their representation, even though mankind should
have been placed upon the earth <i>in many pairs at once,
or in distinct centres of creation</i>. For the brotherhood
of men really depends," &amp;c., &amp;c. (p.&nbsp;201.) "Let us
suppose one to be uncertain whether our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> were
born of the house and lineage of David, <i>or of the
tribe of Levi</i>; and even to be driven to conclude that
the genealogies of Him have <i>little historic value</i>;
nevertheless, in idea, <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is both Son of David and
Son of Aaron, both Prince of Peace, and High Priest
of our profession; as He is, under another idea, though
not literally, 'without father and without mother.'
And He is none the less Son of David, Priest Aaronical,
or Royal Priest Melchizedecan, in idea and spiritually,
even if it be unproved whether He were any
of them <i>in historic fact</i>.&mdash;In like manner it need not
trouble us, if in consistency, we should have to suppose
both an ideal origin, and to apply an ideal meaning,
to the birth in the city of David,&nbsp;(!) and to other
circumstances of the Infancy.&nbsp;(!) So again, the Incarnification
of the divine Immanuel remains, although
the angelic appearances which herald it in the narratives
of the Evangelists may be of ideal origin, according
to the conceptions of former days." (pp.&nbsp;202-3.)
"And," lastly,&mdash;"<i>liberty must be left to all as to the
extent in which they apply this principle</i>!" (p.&nbsp;201.)</p>

<p>To such dreamy nonsense, what "Answer" <i>can</i> we
return<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>? Such speculations would be a fair subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[lxxxiii]</a></span>for ridicule and merriment, if the subject were not so
unspeakably solemn,&mdash;the issues so vast, and terribly
momentous. We find ourselves introduced into a new
world,&mdash;of which the denizens talk like madmen, and
in a jargon of their own. And yet, that jargon is no
sooner understood, than the true character of our new
companions becomes painfully evident<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.... He who
believes the plain words of Holy Writ, finds himself
called "the literalist." He who resolves Scripture
into a dream, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> who redeemed him into
"a mere shadow," (p.&nbsp;200) is dignified with the title
of "an idealist." "Neither" (we are assured) "should
condemn the other. They are fed with the same
truths; the literalist unconsciously, the idealist with
reflection. Neither can justly say of the other that
he undervalues the Sacred Writings, or that he holds
them as inspired less properly than himself." (p.&nbsp;200.)
"The ideologian," (who is the same person as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[lxxxiv]</a></span>"idealist;" for the gentleman, at this place, changes
his name;) "is evidently in possession of a principle
which will enable him to stand in charitable relation
to persons of very different opinions from his own."
(p.&nbsp;202.) "Relations which may repose on doubtful
grounds as matter of history, and, as history, be incapable
of being ascertained or verified, may yet be
equally suggestive of true ideas with facts absolutely
certain. The spiritual significance is the same of the
Transfiguration, of opening blind eyes, of causing the
tongue of the stammerer to speak plainly, of feeding
multitudes with bread in the wilderness, of cleansing
leprosy; whatever links may be deficient in the traditional
records of particular events." (<i>Ibid.</i>) ... I
will but modestly inquire,&mdash;What would be said of
<i>us</i>, if <i>we</i> were so to expound Holy Scripture <i>in defence</i>
of Christianity?</p>

<p>But it is time to dismiss this tissue of worthless as
well as most mischievous writing;&mdash;even to exhibit
which, in the words of its misguided author, ought to
be its own sufficient exposure. Do men really expect
us to "answer" such groundless assertions, and vague
speculations as those which go before? A Faith without
Creeds: a Clergy without authority or fixed opinions:
a Bible without historical truth:&mdash;how can
such things, for a moment, be supposed to be<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>? What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[lxxxv]</a></span>answer do we render to the sick man who sees unsubstantial
goblins on the solid tapestried wall; and
mistakes for shadowy apparitions of the night, the
forms of flesh and blood which are ministering to his
life's necessities? If the Temptation, and the Transfiguration,
and the Miracles of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> be not true history,
but ideological allegories,&mdash;then why not His Nativity
and His Crucifixion,&mdash;His Death and His Burial,&mdash;His
Resurrection and His Ascension into Heaven
likewise? "<i>Liberty</i>" (we have been expressly told,)
"<i>must be left to all, as to the extent in which they apply
the principle</i>" (p.&nbsp;201.)&mdash;<i>Where</i> then is Ideology to
begin,&mdash;or rather, where is ideology to end? "Why
then is Strauss to be blamed for using that universal
liberty, and '<i>resolving into an ideal the whole of the historical
and doctrinal person of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span></i>?' Why is Strauss'
resolution 'an excess?' or where and by what authority,
short of his extreme view, would Mr. Wilson
himself stop? or at what point of the process? and
by what right could he, consistently with his own
canon, call on any other speculator, to stay the ideologizing
process<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>?"</p>

<p>"Discrepancies in narratives, scientific difficulties,
defects in evidence, do not disturb the ideologist as
they do the literalist." (p.&nbsp;203.) No, truly. <i>Nothing</i>
troubles him; simply because he <i>believes nothing</i>!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[lxxxvi]</a></span>The very Sacraments of the Gospel are not secure
from his unhallowed touch. "The same principle" (?)
is declared to be "capable of application" to them
also. "Within these concrete conceptions there lie
hid the truer ideas of the virtual presence of the <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus</span> everywhere that He is preached, remembered,
and represented." (p.&nbsp;204.) ... Do we ever deal thus
with any other book of History? And yet, on what
possible principle is the Bible to be thus trifled with,
and Thucydides to be spared?&mdash;I protest, if the historical
personages of either Testament may be resolved
at will into abstract qualities, and the historical transactions
of either Testament may be supposed to represent
ideas and notions only,&mdash;then, I see not why
the Vicar of Great Staughton himself may not prove
to be a mythical personage also. Why need Henry
Bristow Wilson, B.D.,&mdash;who, (as "literalists" say,)
in 1841 was one of the 'Four Tutors' who procured
the condemnation of Tract No. 90, on the ground that
it 'evaded rather than explained the Thirty-nine Articles;'
and who, in 1861 writes that "Subscription to
the Articles may be thought <i>even inoperative upon the
conscience</i> by reason of its vagueness;" (p.&nbsp;181.)&mdash;why
need this author be supposed to be a man <i>at all</i>?
Why should he not be interpreted "ideologically;"
and resolved into the principle of disgraceful Inconsistency
of conduct, and "variation of opinion at different
periods of life?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>V. In the present crusade against the Bible and
the Faith of Christian men, the task of destroying
confidence in the first chapter of Genesis has been
undertaken by <span class="smcap">Mr. C.&nbsp;W. Goodwin, M.A.</span> He requires
us to "regard it as the speculation of some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[lxxxvii]</a></span>Hebrew Descartes or Newton, promulgated in all
good faith as the best and most probable account
that could be then given of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Universe." (p.&nbsp;252.)</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin remarks with scorn, that "we are
asked to believe that a vision of Creation was presented
to him by Divine power, for the purpose of
enabling him to inform the world of what he had
seen; which vision inevitably led him to give a description
which has misled the world for centuries,
and in which the truth can now only with difficulty
be recognized." (p.&nbsp;247.) He puts "pen to paper,"
therefore, (he says,) in order to induce the world to a
"frank recognition of the erroneous views of nature
which the Bible contains." (p.&nbsp;211.) The importance
of the inquiry, he vindicates in the following modest
terms:&mdash;"Physical Science goes on unconcernedly
pursuing its own paths. Theology, (the Science
whose object is the dealing of <span class="smcap">God</span> with Man as a
moral being,) <i>maintains but a shivering existence,
shouldered and jostled by the sturdy growths of modern
thought</i>, and <i>bemoaning itself</i> for the hostility it encounters."
(p.&nbsp;211.)&mdash;A few remarks at once suggest
themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that if any person of ordinary
intelligence, unacquainted with the Bible, were
to be left to obtain his notion of its contents from
"Essays and Reviews," infidel publications generally,
and (<i>absit invidia verbo!</i>) from not a few of the Sermons
which have been preached and printed in either
University of late years,&mdash;the notion so obtained
would be singularly at variance with the known facts
of the case. Would not a man infallibly carry away
an impression that the Bible is a book abounding in
statements concerning matters of Physical Science
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[lxxxviii]</a></span>which are flatly contradicted by the ascertained phenomena
of Nature? Would he not be led to expect
that it contained every here and there a theoretical
Excursus on certain Astronomical or Physiological
subjects? and to anticipate, above all, an occasional
chapter on Geology? Great would be his astonishment,
surely, at finding that <i>one single chapter</i> comprises
nearly the whole of the statements which modern
philosophy finds so very hateful; and <i>that</i> chapter,
the first chapter in the Bible<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>But the surprise would grow considerably when
the conditions of the problem came to be a little
more fully stated. Has then the actual history of
the World's Creation been ascertained from some other
independent and infallible source? No! Are Geologists
as yet so much as agreed even about a theory
of the Creation? No! Can it be proved that any part
of the Mosaic account is false? Certainly not! Then
why all this hostile dogmatism?&mdash;To witness the violence
of the partisans of Geological discovery, and the
arrogance of their pretensions, one would suppose that
some Divine Creed of theirs had been impugned:
that a revelation had been made to <i>them</i> from Heaven,
which the profane and unbelieving world was reluctant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[lxxxix]</a></span>to accept. Whereas, these are Christian men, impatient,
as it seems, to tear the first leaf out of their
Bible: or rather, to throw discredit on the entire
volume, by establishing the untrustworthiness of the
earliest page!</p>

<p>One single additional consideration completes the
strangeness of the picture. If our account of the Six
Days of Creation were a sybilline leaf of unknown
origin, it would not be unreasonable to treat its revelations
as little worth. But since the author of it is
confessedly Moses,&mdash;the great Hebrew prophet, who
lived from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1571 to 1451, who enjoyed the vision
of the Most High; nay, who conversed with <span class="smcap">God</span>
face to face, was with Him in the Mount for thrice
forty days, and received from Him the whole details
of the Sacred Law;&mdash;since this first chapter of Genesis
is known to have formed a part of the Church's unbroken
heritage from that time onward, and therefore
must be acknowledged to be an integral part of the
volume of Scripture which, (as our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> says,) &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#955;&#965;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;,&mdash;"cannot be broken, diluted, loosened,
explained away;"&mdash;since, further, this account of
Creation is observed to occur in the most conspicuous
place of the most conspicuous of those books which
are designated by an Apostle by the epithet &#952;&#8051;&#959;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;,
or, "given by inspiration," "filled with the
breath," or "Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>;" and when it is considered
that our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and His Apostles refer to the
prim&aelig;val history contained in the first two chapters
about thirty times<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>:&mdash;when, (I say,) all this is duly
weighed, surely too strong a <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> case has been
made out on behalf of the first chapter of Genesis,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[xc]</a></span>that its authority should be imperilled by the random
statements of every fresh individual who sees fit to
master the elements of Geology; and on the strength
of that qualification presumes to sit in judgment on
the Hebrew Scriptures,&mdash;of which, confessedly, he
does not understand so much as the alphabet!</p>

<p>It is even amusing to see how vain a little mind
can become of a little knowledge. Mr. Goodwin remarks,&mdash;"The
school-books of the present day, while
they teach the child that the Earth moves, yet assure
him that it is a little less than six thousand years old,
and that it was made in six days." (p.&nbsp;210.) (I am
puzzled to reconcile this statement with the author's
declaration that "no well-instructed person now doubts
the great antiquity of the Earth any more than its
motion." (<i>Ibid.</i>) Would it not have been fairer to
have <i>named</i> at least <i>one</i> of the school-books which
perpetuate so wicked a heresy?) "On the other hand,
Geologists of all religious creeds are agreed that the
Earth has existed for an immense series of years,&mdash;to
be counted by millions rather than by thousands;
and that indubitably more than six days elapsed from
its first Creation to the appearance of Man upon its
surface. By this broad discrepancy between old and
new doctrine is the modern mind startled, as were
the men of the sixteenth century when told that the
earth moved." (p.&nbsp;210.)</p>

<p>But begging pardon of our philosopher, if all he
means is that more than six days elapsed between the
Creation of "Heaven and Earth," (noticed in ver. 1,)
and the Creation of Man, (spoke of from ver. 26 to 28,)&mdash;he
means to say mighty little; and need not fear
to encounter contradiction from any "well-instructed
person." True, that an ignorant man could not have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[xci]</a></span>suspected anything of the kind from reading the first
chapter of Genesis: but this is surely nobody's fault
but his own. An ignorant man might in like manner
be of opinion that the Sun and Moon are the two
largest objects in creation; and there is not a word
in this same chapter calculated to undeceive him.
Again, he might think that the Sun rises and sets;
and the common language of the Observatory would
confirm him hopelessly in his mistake. All this however
is no one's fault but his own. The ancient Fathers
of the Church, behind-hand as they were in
Physical Science, yet knew enough to anticipate "the
hypothesis of the Geologist; and two of the Christian
Fathers, Augustine and Theodoret, are referred to as
having actually held that a wide interval elapsed between
the first act of Creation, mentioned in the
Mosaic account, and the commencement of the Six
Days' work." (p.&nbsp;231.) Mr. Goodwin therefore has
got no further, so far, than Augustine and Theodoret
got, 1400 years since, without the aid of Geology.</p>

<p>But we must hasten on. The business of the
Essayist, as we have said, is to undermine our confidence
in the Bible, by exposing the ignorance of the
author of the first chapter. "Modern theologians,"
(he remarks, with unaffected displeasure,) "have directed
their attention to the possibility of reconciling
the Mosaic narrative with those geological facts which
are admitted to be beyond dispute." (p.&nbsp;210.)&mdash;And
pray, (we modestly ask,) is not such a proceeding obvious?
A "frank recognition of the erroneous views
of Nature which the Bible contains," (p.&nbsp;211,) we shall
be prepared to yield when those "erroneous views"
have been demonstrated to exist,&mdash;<i>but not till then</i>.
Mr. Goodwin must really remember that although,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[xcii]</a></span>in <i>his</i> opinion, the "Mosaic Cosmogony," (for so he
phrases it,) is "not an authentic utterance of Divine
knowledge, but a human utterance," (p.&nbsp;253,) the
World thinks differently. The learned and wise and
good of all ages, including the present, are happily
agreed that the first chapter of Genesis is <i>part of the
Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>.</p>

<p>After what is evidently intended to be a showy
sketch of the past history of our planet,&mdash;"we pass"
(says Mr. Goodwin) "to the account of the Creation
contained in the Hebrew record. And it must be observed
that in reality two distinct accounts are given
us in the book of Genesis; one, being comprised in
the first chapter and the first three verses of the
second; the other, commencing at the fourth verse of
the second chapter and continuing till the end. This
is so philologically certain that it were useless to
ignore it." (p.&nbsp;217.) Really we read such statements
with a kind of astonishment which almost swallows
up sorrow. Do they arise, (to quote Mr. Goodwin's
own language,) "from our modern habits of thought,
and from the modesty of assertion which the spirit
of true science has taught us?" (p.&nbsp;252.) Convinced
that <i>my</i> unsupported denial would have no more
weight than Mr. Goodwin's ought to have, I have
referred the dictum just quoted to the highest Hebrew
authority available, and have been assured that it is
utterly without foundation.</p>

<p>After such experience of Mr. Goodwin's <i>philological</i>
"certainties," what amount of attention does he expect
his dicta to command in a Science which, starting
from "a region of uncertainty, where Philosophy is
reduced to mere guesses and possibilities, and pronounces
nothing definite," (p.&nbsp;213,) has to travel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[xciii]</a></span>through "a prolonged period, beginning and ending
we know not when;" (p.&nbsp;214;) reaches another period,
"the duration of which no one presumes to define;"
(<i>Ibid.</i>;) and again another, during which "nothing
can be asserted positively:" (p.&nbsp;215:) after which
comes "a kind of artificial break?" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p>For my own part, I freely confess that Mr. Goodwin's
final admission that "the advent of Man may be
considered as inaugurating a new and distinct epoch,
<i>that</i> in which we now are, and during the whole
of which the physical conditions of existence cannot
have been very materially different from what they
are now;" (p.&nbsp;216;) and that "thus much is clear,
that Man's existence on Earth is brief, compared with
the ages during which unreasoning creatures were the
sole possessors of the globe:" (p.&nbsp;217:)&mdash;these statements,
I say, contain as much as one desires to see
admitted. For really, since the fossil Flora, and the
various races of animated creatures which Geologists
have classified with so much industry and skill, confessedly
belong to a period of immemorial antiquity;
and, <i>with very rare exceptions indeed</i>, represent <i>extinct
species</i>,&mdash;I, as an interpreter of Scripture, am not at
all concerned with them. Moses asserts nothing at
all about them, one way or the other. What Revelation
says, is, that nearly 6000 years ago, after
a mighty catastrophe,&mdash;unexplained alike in its cause,
its nature, and its duration,&mdash;the Creator of the Universe
instituted upon the surface of this Earth of ours
that order of things which has continued ever since;
and which is observed at this instant to prevail: that
He was pleased to parcel out His transcendent operations,
and to spread them over Six Days; and that
He ceased from the work of Creation on the Seventh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[xciv]</a></span>Day. All extant species, whether of the vegetable
or the animal Kingdom, including Man himself, belong
to the week in question. And this statement, as it
has never yet been found untrue, so am I unable to
anticipate by what possible evidence it can ever be
set aside as false.</p>

<p>In my IInd Sermon, I have ventured to review
the Mosaic record sufficiently in detail, to render it
superfluous that I should retrace any portion of it
here. The reader is requested to read at least so
much of what has been offered as is contained from
p.&nbsp;28 to p.&nbsp;32. My business at present is with
Mr. Goodwin.</p>

<p>And <i>in limine</i> I have to remind him that he has
really no right first to give, in his own words, his own
notion of the history of Creation; and then to insist
on making <i>the Revelation</i> of the same transaction
ridiculous by giving <i>it</i> also in words of his own,
which become in effect a weak parody of the original.
What is there in Genesis about "<i>the air or wind</i>
fluttering over the waters of the deep?" (p.&nbsp;219.)
Is this meant for the august announcement that "the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> moved upon the face of the waters?"&mdash;"On
the third day, ... we wish to call attention
to the fact that trees and plants destined for food
are those which are particularly singled out as the
earliest productions of the earth." (p.&nbsp;220.) The reverse
is the fact; as a glance at Gen. i. 11. will
shew.&mdash;"The formation of the stars" on the fourth
day, "is mentioned in the most cursory manner."
(p.&nbsp;221.) But <i>who</i> is not aware that "the formation
of the stars" is <i>nowhere mentioned in this chapter
at all</i>?</p>

<p>"Light and the measurement of time," (proceeds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[xcv]</a></span>Mr. Goodwin,) "are represented as existing before
the manifestation of the Sun." (p.&nbsp;219.) Half of this
statement is true; the other half is false. The former
idea, he adds, is "repugnant to our modern knowledge."
(p.&nbsp;219.) Is then Mr. Goodwin really so weak
as to imagine that our Sun is the sole source of Light
in Creation? Whence then the light of the so-called
fixed Stars? But I shall be told that Mr. Goodwin
speaks of <i>our</i> system only, and of our Earth in particular.
Then pray, whence that glory<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> which on a certain
night on a mountain in Galilee, caused the face
of our <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span> to shine as the Sun<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and His raiment
to emit a dazzling lustre<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>? "We may boldly affirm,"
(he says,) "that those for whom [Gen. i. 3-5] was
penned could have taken it in no other sense than
that light existed before and independently of the
sun." (p.&nbsp;219.) We may indeed. And I as boldly
affirm that I take the passage in that sense <i>myself</i>:
moreover that I hold the statement which Mr. Goodwin
treats so scornfully, to be the very truth which,
in the deep counsels of <span class="smcap">God</span>, this passage <i>was designed</i>
to convey to mankind; even that "the King of Kings,
and <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of Lords, who only hath immortality, <i>dwelleth
in the Light which no man can approach unto<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[xcvi]</a></span>
"The work of the second day of Creation is to erect
the vault of Heaven (Heb. <i>Rakia</i>; Gr. &#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8051;&#969;&#956;&#945;;
<i>Lat. Firmamentum</i>,) which is represented as supporting
an ocean of water above it. The waters are said
to be divided, so that some are below, and some above
the vault.... No quibbling about the derivation of
the word <i>Rakia</i>, which is literally 'something beaten
out,' can affect the explicit description of the Mosaic
writer contained in the words 'the waters that are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[xcvii]</a></span>above the firmament,' or avail to shew that he was
aware that the sky is but transparent space." (pp.&nbsp;219,
220.) "The allotted receptacle [of Sun and Moon]
was not made until the Second Day, nor were they
set in it until the fourth." (p.&nbsp;221.) Surely I cannot
be the only reader to whom the impertinence of this
is as offensive, as its shallowness is ridiculous! In
spite of Mr. Goodwin's uplifted finger, and menacing
cry,&mdash;"No quibbling!" I proceed with my inquiry.</p>

<p>For first; Why does Mr. Goodwin parody the
words of Inspiration? The account as given by Moses
is,&mdash;"And <span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let there be a firmament in the
midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>." But surely, to make the "open
firmament of Heaven" in which every winged fowl
may fly<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, is not <i>"to erect the vault of Heaven,"&mdash;"a
permanent solid vault,"&mdash;"supporting an ocean of
water!"</i></p>

<p>The Hebrew word here used to denote "firmament,"
on which Mr. Goodwin's indictment turns, ("<i>rakia</i>,")
is derived from a verb which means to "beat." Now,
what is beaten, or hammered out, while (if it be a
metal) it acquires <i>extension</i>, acquires also <i>solidity</i>. The
Septuagint translators seem to have fastened upon
the latter notion, and accordingly represented it by
&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8051;&#969;&#956;&#945;; for which, the earliest Latin translators
of the Old Testament coined an equivalent,&mdash;<i>firmamentum</i>.
But that Moses by the word "<i>rakia</i>" intended
rather to denote the <i>expanse</i> overhead, than to
predicate <i>solidity</i> for the sky, I suspect will be readily
admitted by all. True that in the poetical book of
Job, we read that the sky is "strong, as a molten
looking-glass<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>:" but then we meet more frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[xcviii]</a></span>with passages of a different tendency. God is said to
"<i>stretch out</i> the heavens <i>like a curtain<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></i>," "and <i>spread
them out as a tent</i> to dwell in<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>:" to "bind up the waters
in His thick clouds<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>," and "<i>in a garment<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></i>," &amp;c., &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
It is only needful to look out the word in the dictionary
of Gesenius to see that <i>spreading out</i>, (as of thin plates
of metal by a hammer,) is the <i>only</i> notion which properly
belongs to the word. Accordingly, the earliest
modern Latin translation from the Hebrew, (that of
Pagninus,) renders the word <i>expansio</i>. And so the
word has stood for centuries in the margin of our
English Bible.</p>

<p>The actual <i>fact</i> of the case,&mdash;the <i>truth</i> concerning
the physical phenomenon alluded to,&mdash;comes in, and
surely may be allowed to have some little weight.
Since expansion <i>is</i> a real attribute of the atmosphere
which divides the waters above from the waters below,&mdash;and
solidity is <i>not</i>,&mdash;it seems to me only fair, seeing
that the force of the expression is thought doubtful,
to assign to it the meaning which is open to
fewest objections.</p>

<p>But "the Hebrews," (says Mr. Goodwin,) "understood
the sky, firmament, or heaven to be a permanent
solid vault, as it appears to the ordinary observer."
This, he adds, is "evident enough from various expressions
made use of concerning it. It is said to
have pillars<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, foundations<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>, doors<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, and windows<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>,"&mdash;(p.
220.) Now, I really do not think Mr. Goodwin's
inference by any means so "evident" as he asserts.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[xcix]</a></span>If Heaven has "pillars" in the poetical book of Job,
so has the Earth<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. The "foundations" spoken of in
2 Sam. xxii. 8, seem rather to belong to <i>Earth</i> than
to Heaven,&mdash;as a reference to the parallel place in
Ps. xviii. 7 will shew<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Is Mr. Goodwin so little of
a poet, as to be staggered by the phrase "windows
of Heaven," when it occurs in the figurative language
of an ancient people, and in a poetical book<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>?</p>

<p>For the foregoing reasons, I distrust Mr. Goodwin's
inference that "the Hebrews understood the sky to be
a solid vault, furnished with pillars, foundations, doors,
and windows." But whether they did, or did not, it
is to be hoped that he is enough of a logician to perceive
that the popular notions of God's ancient people
on this subject, are not the thing in question. The
only <span class="smcap">fact</span> we have to do with is clearly <i>this</i>,&mdash;that
<i>Moses has in this place employed the word "rakia</i>:" and
the only <span class="smcap">question</span> which can be moved about it, is
(as evidently) the following,&mdash;whether he was, or was
not, to blame <i>in employing that word</i>; for as to <i>the
meaning which he, individually, attached to the phenomenon</i>
of which "<i>rakia</i>" is the name, it cannot be
pretended that any one living knows anything at all
about the matter. A Greek, Latin, or French astronomer
who should speak of Heaven, would not therefore
be assumed to mean that it is <i>hollow</i>; although
&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#955;&#959;&#957;, '<i>c[oe]lum</i>,' '<i>ciel</i>,' etymologically imply no less.</p>

<p>Now I contend that Moses employed the word
"<i>rakia</i>" with exactly the same propriety, neither
more nor less, as when a Divine now-a-days employs
the English word "firmament." It does not follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[c]</a></span>that the man who speaks of "the spacious firmament
on high," is under so considerable a delusion as to
suspect that the firmament is <i>a firm thing</i>; nor does it
follow that Moses thought that "<i>rakia</i>" was <i>a solid</i> substance
either,&mdash;even if <i>solidity</i> was the prevailing etymological
notion in the word, and even if the Hebrews
were no better philosophers than Mr. Goodwin would
have us believe. The Essayist's objection is therefore
worthless. <span class="smcap">God</span> was content that Moses should employ
the ordinary language of his day,&mdash;accommodate
himself to the forms of speech then prevalent,&mdash;coin
no new words. What is there unreasonable in the
circumstance? What possible ground does it furnish
for a supposition that the <i>etymological</i> force of the
word,&mdash;or even that the popular physical theory of
which that word may, or may not, have once been the
connotation,&mdash;denoted <i>the sense in which Moses employed
it</i>? Is it to be supposed that when a physician
speaks of a "<i>jovial</i> temperament," he insinuates his
approval of an exploded system of medicine? Do
astronomers maintain that the Sun has a <i>disk</i>, or the
Earth <i>an axis</i>? that the former <i>leaves its place</i> in the
heavens when it suffers 'eclipse<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>?' or that the latter
has a superior <i>latitude</i>, from East to West? To give
the most familiar instance of all,&mdash;Do scientific men
believe that the sun <i>rises</i>, and <i>sets</i>?&mdash;And yet all <i>say</i>
that it does, until this hour!... Why is Moses to be
judged by a less favourable standard than anybody
else,&mdash;than Shakspeare, than Hooker, even than
Mr. Goodwin? The first, in an exquisite passage,
bids Jessica,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Look how the floor of heav'n<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thick inlayed with patens of bright gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci">[ci]</a></span>
Did Shakspeare expect his beautiful language would
be tortured into a shape which would convict him of
talking nonsense?&mdash;But this is poetry. Then take
Hooker's prose:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If the frame of that heavenly arch erected over
our heads should loosen and dissolve itself; ... if the
Moon should wander from her beaten way<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Did Hooker suppose that heaven is "an arch,"
which could be "loosened and dissolved?" or that "the
way" of the moon is "beaten?"&mdash;But this is a highly
poetical passage, written three centuries ago.&mdash;Let an
unexceptionable witness then be called; and so, let the
question be brought to definite issue. <i>I</i>, for my part,
am quite content that it shall be <i>the philosopher in
person</i>. The present Essayist shall be heard discoursing
about Creation, and shall be convicted out of his
own mouth. Mr. Goodwin begins his paper by a kind
of cosmogony of his own, which he prefaces with the
following apology:&mdash;"It will be necessary for our
purpose to go over the oft-trodden ground, which
must be done with rapid steps. Nor let the reader
object to be reminded of some of the most elementary
facts of his knowledge. The human race has been
ages in arriving at conclusions now familiar to every
child." (p.&nbsp;212.) After this preamble, he begins his
"elementary facts," as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Earth, apparently so still and stedfast, lying
in majestic repose beneath the &aelig;therial vault,"&mdash;(p.
212.)</p>

<p>But we remonstrate immediately. "The &aelig;therial
<i>vault</i>!" Do you then understand the sky, firmament,
or heaven to be "a permanent solid vault, as it appears
to the ordinary observer?" (p.&nbsp;220.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[cii]</a></span>
"The Sun which seems to leap up each morning
from the east, and traversing the skyey bridge,"&mdash;(p.
212.)</p>

<p>"The <i>skyey bridge</i>!" And pray in what part of
the universe do you discover a "skyey bridge?" Is
not <i>this</i> calculated "to convey to ordinary apprehensions
an impression at variance with facts?" (p.&nbsp;231.)</p>

<p>"The Moon which occupies a position in the visible
heavens only second to the Sun, and far beyond that
of every other celestial body in conspicuousness,"&mdash;(p.
212.)</p>

<p>Nay, but really Mr. Philosopher, while you remind
us "of some of the most elementary facts of our knowledge,"
(p.&nbsp;212,) you write (except in the matter of
the "leaping Sun" and the "skyey bridge,")&mdash;<i>exactly
as Moses does</i> in the first chapter of Genesis! What
else does that great Prophet say but that "the Moon
occupies a position in the visible heavens only second
to the Sun, and far beyond that of every other celestial
body in conspicuousness?" (p.&nbsp;212.)</p>

<p>Enough, it is presumed, has been offered in reply to
Mr. Goodwin, and his notions of "Mosaic Cosmogony."
He writes with the flippancy of a youth in
his teens, who having just mastered the elements of
natural science, is impatient to acquaint the world
with his achievement. His powers of dogmatism are
unbounded; but he betrays his ignorance at every
step. The Divine decree, "Let us make Man in Our
image, after Our likeness<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>," he explains by remarking
that "the Pentateuch abounds in passages shewing
that the Hebrews contemplated the Divine being in
the visible form of a man."&nbsp;(!!!) (p.&nbsp;221.) A foot-note
contains the following oracular dictum,&mdash;"See particularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii">[ciii]</a></span>the narrative in Genesis xviii." What <i>can</i>
be said to such an ignoramus as this? Hear him dogmatizing
in another subject-matter:&mdash;"The common
arrangement of the Bible in chapters is of comparatively
modern origin, and is admitted on all hands
to have no authority or philological worth whatever.
In many cases the division is most preposterous."
(p.&nbsp;222.) That the division of chapters is occasionally
infelicitous, is true: but is Mr. Goodwin weak enough
to think that he could divide them better? The
division into chapters and verses again is <i>not</i> so
modern as Mr. Goodwin fancies. Dr. M'Caul, (in
a pamphlet on the Translation of the Bible,) shews
reason for suspecting that some of the divisions of
the Old Testament Scriptures are as old as the time
of Ezra.</p>

<p>To return, and for the last time, to Mr. Goodwin's
Essay.&mdash;His object is, (with how much of success I
have already sufficiently shewn,) (1)&nbsp;To fasten the
charge of absurdity and ignorance on the ancient Prophet
who is confessedly the author of the Book of
Genesis: (2)&nbsp;To prove that a literal interpretation
of Gen. i., "will not bear a moment's serious discussion."
(p.&nbsp;230.) I look through his pages in
vain for the wished-for proof. He has many strong
assertions. He puts them forth with not a little insolence.
But he proves nothing! At p.&nbsp;226, however,
I read as follows:&mdash;"Dr. Buckland appears to
assume that when it is said that the Heaven and the
Earth were created in the beginning, it is to be understood
that they were created in their present form
and state of completeness, the heaven raised above
the earth as we see it, or seem to see it now."
(pp.&nbsp;226-7.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[civ]</a></span>
But Dr. Buckland "appears to assume" nothing of
the kind. His words are,&mdash;"The first verse of Genesis
seems explicitly to assert the creation of <i>the Universe</i>:
the Heaven, including the sidereal systems,&mdash;and the
Earth, ... the subsequent scene of the operations of
the six days about to be described." (pp.&nbsp;224-5.)</p>

<p>"This," continues Mr. Goodwin, "is the fallacy of
his argument." (p.&nbsp;227.)</p>

<p>But if this is "<i>the</i> fallacy of his argument," we
have already seen that it is a fallacy which rests
not with Dr. Buckland, but with Mr. Goodwin. He
proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The circumstantial description of the framing of
the Heaven out of the waters proves that the words
'Heaven and Earth,' in the first verse, must be taken
proleptically."&mdash;(p.&nbsp;227.)</p>

<p>But we may as well stop the torrent of long words,
by simply pointing out that "the heavens," (<i>hashamaim</i>,)
spoken of in Gen. i. 1, are quite distinct from
"the firmament," (<i>rakia</i>,) spoken of in ver. 6. The
word is altogether different, and the sense is evidently
altogether different also; although Mr. Goodwin seeks
to identify the two<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. And further, we take leave to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[cv]</a></span>remind our modern philosopher that <i>no</i> "circumstantial
description of the framing of the heaven out
of the waters," is to be found either in ver. 6, or elsewhere.
And this must suffice.</p>

<p>The entire subject shall be dismissed with a very
few remarks.&mdash;Mr. Goodwin delights in pointing out
the incorrectness of "the sense in which the Mosaic
narrative was taken by those who first heard it:"
(p.&nbsp;223:) and in asserting "that this meaning is <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i> one wholly adverse to the present astronomical
and geological views of the Universe." (p.&nbsp;223.) But
we take leave to remind this would-be philosopher
that "the idea which entered into the minds of those
to whom the account was first given," (p.&nbsp;230,) is not
the question with which we have to do when we are
invited to a "frank recognition of the erroneous views
of Nature which the Bible contains." (p.&nbsp;211.) "It
is manifest,"&mdash;(in this I cordially agree with Mr.
Goodwin,)&mdash;"that the whole account is given from
a different point of view from that which we now unavoidably
take:" (p.&nbsp;223:) and, (I beg leave to add,)
<i>that</i> point of view is <i>somewhere in Heaven</i>,&mdash;not here
on Earth! The "Mosaic Cosmogony," as Mr. Goodwin
phrases it, (fond, like all other smatterers in
Science, of long words,) is <i>a Revelation</i>: and the same
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> who gave it, speaking by the mouth of
St. John, not obscurely intimates that it is mystical,
like the rest of Holy Scripture,&mdash;that is, that it was
fashioned not without a reference to the Gospel<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[cvi]</a></span>But we are touching on a high subject now, of which
Mr. Goodwin does not understand so much as the
Grammar. <i>He</i> is thinking of the structure of the
globe: <i>we</i> are thinking of the structure <i>of the Bible</i>.
But to return to Earth, we inform the Essayist that it
is simply unphilosophical, even absurd, for him to
insist on what <i>shall</i> be implied by certain words employed
by Moses,&mdash;(of which he judges by their etymology;)
and further to assume what erroneous physical
theories those words must have been connected
with, by his countrymen, and so forth; and straightway
to hold up the greatest of the ancient prophets
to ridicule, as if those notions and those theories were
all <i>his</i>!</p>

<p>"After all," (as Dr. Buckland remarked, long since,)
"it should be recollected that the question is not respecting
the correctness of the Mosaic narrative, but
of our interpretation of it:" (p.&nbsp;231:)&mdash;"a proposition,"
(proceeds Mr. Goodwin,) "which can hardly be
sufficiently reprobated." But I make no question
which of these two writers is most entitled to reprobation.
For the view which will be found advocated
in Sermon II., (which is substantially Dr. Buckland's,)
(p.&nbsp;24 to p.&nbsp;32,) it shall but be said that it recommends
itself to our acceptance by the strong fact that
it takes <i>no</i> liberty with the sacred narrative, whatever;
and receives the Revelation of <span class="smcap">God</span> in all its
strangeness, (which it <i>cannot</i> be a great mistake to
do;) without trying to reconcile it with supposed discoveries,
(wherein we <i>may</i> fail altogether.) I defy
anybody to shew that it is <i>impossible</i> that <span class="smcap">God</span> may
have disposed of the actual order of the Universe, as
in the first chapter of Genesis He is related to have
done; and <i>probability</i> can clearly have no place in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[cvii]</a></span>such a speculation. I would only just remind the
thoughtful student of Scripture, and indeed of Nature
also, that the singular <i>analogy</i> which Geologists think
they discover between successive periods of Creation,
and the Mosaic record of the first Six Days, is no
difficulty to those who hesitate to identify those Days
with the irregular Periods of indefinite extent. Rather
was it to have been expected, I think, that such
an analogy would be found to subsist between His
past and His present working, when, 6,000 years ago,
<span class="smcap">God</span> arranged the actual system of things in Six
Days.&mdash;Neither need we feel perplexed if Hugh Miller
was right in the conclusion at which, he says, he had
been "compelled to arrive;" viz. that "not a few"
of the extant species of animals "enjoyed life in their
present haunts" "for many long ages ere Man was
ushered into being;" "and that for thousands of years
anterior to even <i>their</i> appearance many of the existing
molluscs lived in our seas." (p.&nbsp;229.) I find it nowhere
asserted <i>by Moses</i> that the severance was so
complete, and decisively marked, between previous
cycles of Creation and that cycle which culminated in
the creation of Man, <i>that</i> no single species of the pr&aelig;-Adamic
period was reproduced by the Omnipotent,
to serve as a connecting link, as it were, between the
Old world and the New,&mdash;an identifying note of the
Intelligence which was equally at work on this last,
as on all those former occasions. On the other hand,
I <i>do</i> find it asserted <i>by Geologists</i> that between the
successive pr&aelig;-Adamic cycles such connecting links
are discoverable; and this fact makes me behold in
the circumstance supposed fatal to the view here
advocated, the strongest possible confirmation of its
accuracy. At the same time, it is admitted that in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[cviii]</a></span>every department of animated and vegetable life, the
severance between the last (or Mosaic) cycle of Creation,
and all those cycles which preceded it, is <i>very</i>
broadly marked<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin's method contrasts sadly with that
of the several writers he adduces,&mdash;whether Naturalists
or Divines. Those men, believing in the truth of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> Word, have piously endeavoured, (with whatever
success,) to shew that the discoveries of Geology
are not inconsistent with the revelations of Genesis.
But he, with singular bad taste, (to use no stronger
language,) makes no secret of the animosity with
which he regards the inspired record; and even finds
"the spectacle of able, and we doubt not conscientious
writers engaging in attempting the impossible,&mdash;painful
and humiliating." He says, "they evidently
do not breathe freely over their work; but shuffle and
stumble over their difficulties in a piteous manner."
(p.&nbsp;250.) He asserts dogmatically that "the interpretation
proposed by Buckland to be given to the
Mosaic description, will not bear a moment's serious
discussion:" (p.&nbsp;230:) while Hugh Miller "proposes
to give an entirely mythical or enigmatical sense to
the Mosaic narrative." (p.&nbsp;236.) He is clamorous
that we should admit the teaching of Scripture to be
"to some extent erroneous." (p.&nbsp;251.) He "recognizes
in it, not an authentic utterance of Divine Knowledge,
but a human utterance." (p.&nbsp;253.) "Why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[cix]</a></span>should we hesitate," (he asks,) "to recognize the fallibility
of the Hebrew writers?" (p.&nbsp;251.)</p>

<p>With one general reflexion, I pass on to the next
Essay.&mdash;The Works of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the more severely they
have been questioned, have hitherto been considered
to bear a more and more decisive testimony to the
Wisdom and the Goodness of their Author. The animal
and the vegetable kingdoms have been made Man's
instructors for ages past; and ever since the microscope
has revealed so many unsuspected wonders, the
argument from contrivance and design, Creative Power
and infinite Wisdom, has been pressed with increasing
cogency. The Heavens, from the beginning, have
been felt to "declare the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>." One department
only of Nature, alone, has all along remained
unexplored. Singular to relate, the Records of Creation,
(as the phenomena of Geology may I suppose be
properly called,)&mdash;though the most obvious phenomena
of all,&mdash;have been throughout neglected. It was not
till the other day that they were invited to give up
their weighty secrets; and lo, they have confessed
them, willingly and at once. The study of Geology
does but date from yesterday; and already it aspires
to the rank of a glorious Science. Evidence has been
at once furnished that our Earth has been the scene
of successive cycles of Creation; and the crust of the
globe we inhabit is found to contain evidence of a degree
of antiquity which altogether defies conjecture.
The truth is, that Man, standing on a globe where
his deepest excavations bear the same relation to the
diameter which the scratch of a pin invisible to
the naked eye, bears to an ordinary globe;&mdash;learns
that his powers of interrogating Nature break down
marvellous soon: yet Nature is observed to keep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cx" id="Page_cx">[cx]</a></span>from him no secrets which he has the ability to ask
her to give up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the attitude assumed by certain
pretenders to Physical Science at these discoveries,
cannot fail to strike any thoughtful person as extraordinary.
Those witnesses of <span class="smcap">God's</span> work in Creation,
which have been dumb for ages only because no man
ever thought of interrogating them, are now regarded
in the light of depositaries of a mighty secret; which,
because <span class="smcap">God</span> knew that it would be fatal to the credit
of His written Word, He had bribed them to keep
back, as long as, by shuffling and equivocation, they
found concealment practicable. It seems to be fancied,
however, that <i>that</i> fatal secret the determination of
Man has wrung from their unwilling lips, at last; and
lo, on confronting <span class="smcap">God</span> with these witnesses, He is
convicted even by His own creatures of having spoken
falsely in His Word<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.&mdash;Such, I say, is the tone assumed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi">[cxi]</a></span>of late by a certain school of pretenders to
Physical Science.</p>

<p>What need to declare that to the well-informed eye
of Faith,&mdash;(and surely Faith is here the perfection
of Reason! for <i>Faith</i>, remember, is the correlative
not of <i>Reason</i>, but of <i>Sight</i>;)&mdash;the phenomenon presented
is of a widely different character. Faith, or
rather Reason, looks upon <span class="smcap">God's</span> Works <i>as a kind of
complement of His Word</i>. He who gave the one, gave
the other also. Moreover, He knew that He had
given it. So far from ministering to unbelief, or
even furnishing grounds for perplexity, the record
of His Works was intended, according to His gracious
design, to supply what was lacking to our knowledge
in the record of His Word.... "Behold My footprints,
(He seems to say,) across the long tract of the ages!
I could not give you this evidence in My written
Word. The record would have been out of place,
and out of time. It would have been unintelligible
also. But what I knew would be inexpedient in the
page of Revelation, I have given you abundantly in
the page of Nature. I have spared your globe from
combustion, which would have effaced those footprints,&mdash;in
order that the characters might be plainly decipherable
to the end of Time.... O fools and blind,
to have occupied a world so brimful of wonders for
wellnigh 6000 years, and only now to have begun to
open your eyes to the structure of the earth whereon
ye live, and move, and have your being! Yea, and
the thousandth part of the natural wonders by which
ye are surrounded has not been so much as dreamed of,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[cxii]</a></span>by any of you, yet!... O learn to be the humbler,
the more ye know; and when ye gaze along the
mighty vista of departed ages, and scan the traces of
what I was doing before I created Man,&mdash;multiply
that problem by the stars which are scattered in
number numberless over all the vault of Heaven; and
learn to confess that it behoves the creature of an
hour to bow his head at the discovery of his own
littleness and blindness; and that his words concerning
the Ancient of Days had need to be at once very
wary, and very few!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>VI. By far the ablest of these seven Essays is from
the pen of the "<span class="smcap">Rev. Mark Pattison, B.D.</span>, Rector of
Lincoln College, Oxford." It purports to be an Essay
on the "<span class="smcap">Tendencies of Religious Thought in England</span>,
1688-1750;" but it can hardly be said to
correspond with that description. In the concluding
paragraph, the learned writer gives to his work a different
name. It is declared to be "<i>The past History
of the Theory of Belief in the Church of England</i><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>."
But neither the title at the head, nor the title at the
tail of the Essay, gives any adequate notion of the
Author's purpose.</p>

<p>Had we met with this production, isolated, in the
pages of a Review, we should have probably passed it
by as the work of a clever man, who, after amusing
himself to some extent with the Theological literature
of the last century, had desired to preserve some record
of his reading; and had here thrown his random jottings
into connected form. There is a racy freshness
in a few of Mr. Pattison's sketches, (as in his account
of Bentley's controversy with Collins<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>,) which forcibly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxiii" id="Page_cxiii">[cxiii]</a></span>suggests the image of an artist whose pencil cannot
rest amid scenery which stimulates his imagination.
To be candid, we are inclined to suspect that, in the
first instance, something of this sort was in reality all
that the learned author had in view. But we are
reluctantly precluded from putting so friendly a construction
on these seventy-six pages. Not only does
Mr. Pattison's Essay stand between Mr. Goodwin's open
endeavour to destroy confidence in the writings of
Moses, and Professor Jowett's laborious insinuations
that the Bible is only an ordinary book; but it claims
a common purpose and intention with both those
writers. Mr. Pattison's avowed object is "to illustrate
the advantage derivable to the cause of religious
and moral truth, from a free handling, in a becoming
spirit, of subjects peculiarly liable to suffer by the repetition
of conventional language, and from traditional
methods of treatment<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>." We proceed therefore to
examine his labours by the aid of the clue which he
has himself supplied. For when nine editions of a
book appear in quick succession, prefaced by a description
of the spirit in which "<i>it is hoped that the
volume will he received</i>,"&mdash;it seems a pity that the
author should not be judged by the standard of his
own choosing.</p>

<p>We are surprised then to find how slightly Mr.
Pattison's Essay fulfils its avowed purpose. The
learned author does not, in fact, <i>directly</i> "handle"
the class of subjects referred to, <i>at all</i>: or if he does,
it is achieved in a couple of pages. And yet it is not
difficult to point out the part which his Essay performs
in the general scheme of this guilty volume. With
whatever absence of "concert or comparison" the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxiv" id="Page_cxiv">[cxiv]</a></span>authors may have severally written, the fatal effect
of their combined endeavours is not more apparent
than the part sustained by each Essay singly in promoting
it.</p>

<p>While Mr. Goodwin demolishes the Law, and Dr.
Williams disbelieves the Prophets; while Professor
Powell denies the truth of Miracles, and Professor
Jowett evacuates the authority of Holy Scripture altogether&mdash;while
Dr. Temple substitutes the inner light
of Conscience for an external Revelation; and Mr.
Wilson teaches men how they may turn the substance
of Holy Scripture into a shadow, evade the plain force
of language, and play fast and loose with those safeguards
which it has been ever thought that words
supply;&mdash;Mr. Pattison, reviewing the last century and
a half of our own Theological history, labours hard to
produce an impression that, <i>here</i> also "all is vanity
and vexation of spirit." He calls off our attention
from the Bible, and bids us contemplate the unlovely
aspect of the English "religious world" from the
Revolution of 1688 down to the publication of the
'Tracts for the Times,' in 1833<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. "Be content for
a while, (he seems to say,) to disregard the prize; and
observe the combatants instead. Listen to the historian
of moral and religious progress," while he depicts
"decay of religion, licentiousness of morals,
public corruption, profaneness of language, a day of
rebuke and blasphemy." Come attend to me; and I
will draw the likeness of "an age destitute of depth
or earnestness; an age whose poetry was without
romance, whose philosophy was without insight, and
whose public men were without character; an age of
'light without love,' whose 'very merits were of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxv" id="Page_cxv">[cxv]</a></span>earth, earthy.'" (p.&nbsp;254.) "If we would understand
our own position in the Church, and that of the Church
in the age; if we would hold any clue through the
maze of religious pretension which surrounds us; we
cannot neglect those immediate agencies in the production
of the present, which had their origin towards
the beginning of the eighteenth century." (p.&nbsp;256.)
Let us then "trace the descent of religious thought,
and the practical working of the religious ideas," (p.
255,) through some of the phases they have more
recently assumed. You shall see the Apostles tried
on a charge "of giving false witness in the case of the
Resurrection of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>;" (p.&nbsp;303;) and pronounced
"not guilty," by one whose "name once commanded
universal homage among us;" but who now,&nbsp;(!) with
South&nbsp;(!!) and Barrow,&nbsp;(!!!) "excites perhaps only
a smile of pity." (p.&nbsp;265.) You shall be shewn Bentley
in his attack on Collins the freethinker, enjoying
"rare sport,"&mdash;"rat-hunting in an old rick;" and
"laying about him in high glee, braining an authority
at every blow." (p.&nbsp;308.) "Coarse, arrogant, and
abusive, with all Bentley's worst faults of style and
temper, this masterly critique is decisive." (p.&nbsp;307.)
And yet, you are not to rejoice! "The 'Discourse of
Freethinking' was a small tract published in 1713 by
Anthony Collins, a gentleman whose high personal
character and general respectability seemed to give
a weight to his words, which assuredly they do not
carry of themselves." (p.&nbsp;307.) [Why, the man ought
to have been an Essayist and Reviewer!] ... "By
'freethinking'" he does but "mean liberty of thought,&mdash;the
right of bringing all received opinions whatsoever
to the touchstone of reason:" (p.&nbsp;307:) [a liberty
which has evidently disappeared from English Litera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxvi" id="Page_cxvi">[cxvi]</a></span>ture:
a right which no man dares any longer exercise
under pain of excommunication!] "Collins was not
a sharper, and would have disdained practices to which
Bentley stooped for the sake of a professorship." (p.
310.) [O high-minded Collins!] "The dirt endeavoured
to be thrown on Collins will cleave to the hand
that throws it." (p.&nbsp;309.) [O dirty Bentley!] And
though "Collins's mistakes, mistranslations, misconceptions,
and distortions are so monstrous, that it is
difficult for us now, forgetful how low classical learning
had sunk, to believe that they <i>are</i> mistakes, and
not wilful errors," (p.&nbsp;308,)&mdash;yet "Addison, the pride
of Oxford, had done no better. In his 'Essay on the
Evidences of Christianity,' Addison 'assigns as grounds
for his religious belief, stories as absurd as that of the
Cock-lane ghost, and forgeries as rank as Ireland's
'Vortigern;' puts faith in the lie about the thundering
legion; is convinced that Tiberius moved the
Senate to admit <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> among the gods; and pronounces
the letter of Agbarus, King of Edessa, to be
a record of great authority.'" (p.&nbsp;307, quoting Macaulay's
<i>Essays</i>.) All this and much more you shall
see. Remember that it is the history of your immediate
forefathers which you will be contemplating,&mdash;the
morality of the professors of religion during the
last century,&mdash;"the past history of the theory of
Belief in the Church of England!" (p.&nbsp;329.)</p>

<p>The curtain falls; and now, pray how do you
like it? I invite you, in conclusion, to "take the
religious literature of the present day, as a whole;
and endeavour to make out clearly on what basis
Revelation is supposed by it to rest; whether on
Authority, on the Inward Light, on Reason, on self-evidencing
Scripture, or on the combination of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxvii" id="Page_cxvii">[cxvii]</a></span>four, or some of them, and in what proportions."
(p.&nbsp;329.) ... After this, you are at liberty to proceed
to read 'Jowett on Inspiration,'&mdash;with what
appetite you may!</p>

<p>Such is the impression which Mr. Pattison's Essay
is calculated to leave behind. That he had no wicked
intention in writing it, no one who knows him could
for an instant suppose: but <i>the effect</i> of what he has
done is certainly to set his reader adrift on a dreary
sea of doubt. Discomfort and dissatisfaction, confusion
and dismay, are the prevailing sentiments with
which a religious mind, unfortified with learning,
will rise from the perusal of the present Essay: while
the irreligious man will study it with a sneer of ill-concealed
satisfaction. The marks of Mr. Pattison's
own better knowledge, (sufficiently evident to the
quick eye of one who is aware of the writer's high
theological attainments;)&mdash;the indications of a truer
individual judgment, (discoverable throughout by one
who <i>knows</i> the author's private worth, and is himself
happily in possession of the clue by which to escape
from this tangled labyrinth:)&mdash;<i>these</i> escape the common
reader. To <i>him</i>, all is dreary doubt.</p>

<p>I must perforce deal with Mr. Pattison's labours
in a very summary manner. The chief complaint I
have to make against him is that he has altogether
omitted what, to you and to me, is the <i>most</i> important
feature of the century which he professes to describe,&mdash;namely,
the vast amount of lofty Churchmanship,
the unbroken Catholic tradition, which, with no small
amount of general short-coming, is to be traced
throughout the eighteenth century. To insinuate that
the return to Catholic principles <i>began</i> with the publication
of the 'Tracts for the Times,' (p.&nbsp;259,) in 1833,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxviii" id="Page_cxviii">[cxviii]</a></span>is simply to insinuate what is <i>not</i> true. But Mr.
Pattison does more than 'insinuate.' He states it
openly. "In constructing <i>Caten&aelig; Patrum</i>," (he says,)
"the Anglican closes his list with Waterland or
Brett, and leaps at once to 1833." (p.&nbsp;255.)&mdash;Now,
since Waterland <i>died</i> in 1740 and Brett in 1743, it
is clear that, (according to Mr. Pattison,) a hundred
years and upwards have to be cleared <i>per saltum</i>:
during which the lamp of Religion in these kingdoms
had gone fairly out. But how stands the truth? At
least <i>four</i> "Caten&aelig; Patrum" are given in the "Tracts
for the Times<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>;" <i>not one</i> of which is closed with
Waterland or Brett. On the contrary, in the two
former Caten&aelig; (beginning with Jewel and Hooker)
the names of these supposed 'ultimi Romanorum' occur
little more than <i>half way</i>!... "Les faits," therefore,
(as usual with 'Essayists and Reviewers,')&mdash;"<i>les faits
sont contraires</i>."&mdash;It would be enough to cite Bethell's
'General View of the Doctrine of Regeneration in Baptism,'
which appeared in 1822; and Hugh James
Rose's 'Discourses on the Commission and Duties of
the Clergy,' which were preached in 1826. But the
case against Mr. Pattison, as I shall presently shew,
is abundantly stronger.</p>

<p>In short, to exclude from sight, as this author so
laboriously endeavours to do, the Catholic element of
the last century and the early part of the present,
is extremely unfair. There had <i>never failed</i> in the
Church of England a succession of illustrious men,
who transmitted the Divine fire unimpaired, down
to yesterday. Quenched in some places, the flame
burned up brightly and beautifully in others. As
for the 'Tracts for the Times,' they speedily assumed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxix" id="Page_cxix">[cxix]</a></span>a party character: and by the time that ninety-seven
of them had appeared, the series was discontinued by
the desire of the Diocesan,&mdash;who was yet the friend
of its authors. The Tracts do not all, by any means,
represent Anglican (i.e. Catholic) Theology. They
were written by a very few men; while the greatest
of those who had materially promoted the Catholic
movement out of which they sprang, (<i>not</i> which they
<i>occasioned</i>,) were dissatisfied with them; would not
write in them; kept aloof; and foresaw and foretold
what would be the issue of such teaching<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. And
yet, 'Tracts for the Times' did more good than evil,
I suppose, on the whole.</p>

<p>The truth is, that in every age, (and the last century
forms no exception to the rule,) the history of
the Church on Earth has been a <i>warfare</i>. Mr. Pattison
says contemptuously,&mdash;"The current phrases of
'the bulwarks of our faith,' 'dangerous to Christianity,'
are but instances of the habitual position in which we
assume ourselves to stand. Even more philosophic
minds cannot get rid of the idea that Theology is
polemical." (p.&nbsp;301.) And pray, whom have we to
thank, but such writers as Mr. Pattison, that it is so?
I am one of the many who at this hour are (unwillingly)
neglecting <i>constructive</i> tasks in order to be <i>destructive</i>
with Mr. Pattison and his colleagues! So long as Infidelity
abounds, our service <i>must</i> be a warfare. 'The
Prince of Peace' foretold as much, when He prophesied
to His Disciples that it would be found that He had
"brought on earth, a sword." As much was typically
adumbrated, I suspect, (begging Mr. Jowett's pardon,)
when, at the rebuilding of the walls of the Holy City,
"they which builded on the wall, and they that bare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxx" id="Page_cxx">[cxx]</a></span>burdens, with those that laded, every one with one
of his hands wrought in the work, and <i>with the other
hand held a weapon</i>. For the builders, every one had
his sword girded by his side, and so builded<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>." May
I not add that the unique position which the Church
of England has occupied, ever since her great Reformation
in respect both of Doctrine and of Discipline
three centuries ago,&mdash;is of a nature which must inevitably
subject her to constant storms? An object
of envy to 'Protestant Europe,'&mdash;and of hatred to
Rome;&mdash;exposed to the hostility of the State, (which
would trample her under foot, if it dared,)&mdash;and
viewed with ill-concealed animosity by Dissenters of
every class;&mdash;admitting into her Ministry men of
very diverse views,&mdash;and restraining them by scarcely
any discipline;&mdash;allowing perfect freedom, aye, licentiousness
of discussion,&mdash;and tolerating the expression
of almost any opinions,&mdash;<i>except those of Essayists and
Reviewers</i>:&mdash;how shall the Church of England fail to
adopt 'the bulwarks of the faith' for one of her current
phrases? how not, many a time, deem 'dangerous
to Christianity' the speculations of her sons?... Nay,
polemics <i>must</i> prevail; if only because, in a
certain place, the Divine Speaker already quoted
foretells the partial, (if not the <i>entire</i>,) obscuration
even of true Doctrine, in that pathetic exclamation
of His,&mdash;"When the Son of Man cometh, shall He
find the faith upon the Earth<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>?" ... In the face of
all this, it is to confuse and mystify the ordinary
reader to draw such a picture of the last century as
Mr. Pattison has drawn here. As dismal a view might
be easily taken of the first, of the second, of the third,
of the fourth, of the fifth century. What Mr. Newman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxi" id="Page_cxxi">[cxxi]</a></span>once designated as "ancient, holy, and happy
times," might very easily indeed be so exhibited as
to seem times of confusion and discord, blasphemy
and rebuke. A discouraging picture might be drawn,
(I suppose,) of every age of the Church's history.
But in, and by itself, it would never be quite a <i>true</i>
picture. For to the eye of Faith there is ever to be
descried, amid the hurly-burly of the storm, the Ark
of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> Church floating peacefully over the troubled
waters, and making steadily for that Heavenly
haven "where it would be." ... Yes, there is ever
some blessed trace discoverable, that this Life of ours
is watched over by One whose Name is Love; whether
we con the chequered page of History, Ecclesiastical
or Civil; or summon to our aid the story of
our own narrow experience. From the fierce and
fiery opposition, Good is ever found to have resulted;
and <i>that</i> Good was <i>abiding</i>. Out of the weary conflict
ever has issued Peace; and <i>that</i> Peace was of the kind
which 'passeth all understanding;' a Peace which the
world cannot give,&mdash;no, nor take away. There are
abundant traces that in all that has happened to the
Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, from first to last, there has been
a purpose and a plan!... No one knows this better
than Mr. Pattison. No man in Oxford could have
drawn out what I have been saying into a convincing
reality, better than he, had he yielded to the instincts
of a good heart, and directed his fine abilities to their
lawful scope.</p>

<p>The character of the last dismal century, Mr. Pattison
has drawn with sufficient vividness: but that
century armed the Church, (as we shall be presently
reminded,) on the side of the "Evidences of Religion;"
and if it taught her the insufficiency of such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxii" id="Page_cxxii">[cxxii]</a></span>a method, the eighteenth century did its work. Above
all, <i>it produced Bishop Butler</i>.&mdash;The previous century,
(the seventeenth,) witnessed the supremacy of fanaticism.
It saw the monarchy laid prostrate, and the
Church trampled under foot, and the use of the Liturgy
prohibited by Act of Parliament. The "Sufferings of
the Clergy" fill a folio volume. But this was the century
which produced our great Caroline Divines! From
Bp. Andrewes to Bp. Pearson,&mdash;<i>what</i> a galaxy of names!
Moreover, on the side of the Romish controversy, the
seventeenth century supplied the Church's armoury
for ever,&mdash;Stillingfleet, who died in the year 1699, in
a manner closing the strife.&mdash;The sixteenth century
witnessed the Reformation of Religion, with all its
inevitably attendant evils; an unsettled faith,&mdash;gross
public and private injustice,&mdash;an illiterate parochial
clergy:&mdash;yet how goodly a body of sound Divinity
did the controversies of that age call forth! The same
century witnessed the rise of Puritanism; but then,
it produced Richard Hooker!&mdash;What was the character
of the century which immediately preceded the
Reformation,&mdash;the fifteenth?... A tangled web of
good and evil has been the Church's history from the
very first. The counterpart of what we read of in
Eusebius and Socrates is to be witnessed among ourselves
at the present day, and will doubtless be witnessed
to the end! But then, in days of deepest discouragement,
faithful men have never been found
wanting to the English Church, (no, nor <span class="smcap">God</span> helping
her, ever <i>will</i>!) who, like the late Hugh James Rose,
"when hearts were failing, bade us stir up the gift
that was in us, and betake ourselves to our true
Mother." Mean wilee, such names as George Herbert
and Nicholas Farrar, Ken and Nelson, Leighton and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxiii" id="Page_cxxiii">[cxxiii]</a></span>Bishop Wilson, shine through the gloom like a constellation
of quiet stars; to which the pilgrim lifts
his weary eye, and <i>feels</i> that he is looking up to
Heaven!</p>

<p>When the spirit of the Age comes into collision
with the spirit of the Gospel, the result is sometimes
(as in the earliest centuries,) portentous;&mdash;sometimes,
(as in the last,) simply deplorable and grievous. The
battle which seems to be at present waging is of
a different nature. Physical Science has undertaken
the perilous task of hardening herself against the <span class="smcap">God</span>
of Nature. We shall probably see this unnatural
strife prolonged for many years to come;&mdash;to be succeeded
by some fresh form of irreligion. Somewhat
thus, I apprehend, will it be to the end: and the men
of every age will in those conflicts find their best probation;
and it will still be the office of the Creator,
in this way to separate the Light from the Darkness,&mdash;until
the dawn of the everlasting Morning!</p>

<p>It is not proposed to enter into the Rationalism
of the last century, therefore; or to inquire into the
causes of the barren lifeless shape into which Theology
then, for the most part, threw itself. I have never
made that department of Ecclesiastical History my
study: and <i>who</i> does not turn away from what is joyless
and dreary, to greener meadows, and more fertile
fields? It shall only be remarked that when the
<i>Credibility</i> of Religion is the thing generally denied,
<i>Evidences</i> will of necessity be the form which much
of the Theological writing of the Day will assume.
Let it not be imagined for an instant that one is the
apologist of what Mr. Pattison has characterized as
"an age of Light without Love." (p.&nbsp;254.) But
I insist that the theological picture of the last century
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxiv" id="Page_cxxiv">[cxxiv]</a></span>is incomplete, until attention has been called to the
many redeeming features which it presents, and which
are all of a re-assuring kind.</p>

<p>Thus, in the department of sacred scholarship, <i>who</i>
can forgot that our learned John Mill, in 1707, gave
to the world that famous edition of the New Testament
which bears his name, after thirty years of patient
toil? Who can forget our obligations in Hebrew,
to Kennicott? (1718-1783.) Humphrey Hody's
great work on the Text, and older Versions of Holy
Scripture, was published in 1705.&mdash;Bingham's immortal
'Origines' began to appear in 1708; and
William Cave lived till 1714.</p>

<p>In the same connexion should be mentioned Bp.
Gibson, who died in 1748, and Humphrey Prideaux,
whose 'Connexion' is dated 1715. Pococke died on
the eve of the commencement of the last century
(1691); but so great a name casts a bright beam
through the darkness which Mr. Pattison describes so
forcibly. Archbishop Wake died in 1737. Warton,
the author of 'Anglia Sacra,' died at the age of 35
in 1695.</p>

<p>Survey next the field of Divinity, properly so called;
and in the face of Mr. Pattison's rash statement that
"we have no classical Theology since 1660," (p.&nbsp;265,)
take notice that Bp. Bull, one of the greatest Divines
which the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> ever bred, did not begin
to write until 1669, and lived to the year 1709. This
was the man, remember, who received the thanks of
the whole Gallican Church for his 'Judicium Ecclesi&aelig;
Catholic&aelig;,' (i.e. his learned assertion of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's
God</span>head<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>;)&mdash;the man whose writings would have won
him the reverence and affection of Athanasius and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxv" id="Page_cxxv">[cxxv]</a></span>Augustine and Basil, had he lived in their day; for
he had a mind like theirs. Bp. Pearson did not die
till 1686. Bp. Beveridge wrote till his death in 1707.
Fell, the learned editor of Cyprian, died in 1686:
Stillingfleet lived till 1699. Wall's History of Infant
Baptism appeared in 1705. Wheatly, who led
the way in liturgical inquiry, was alive till 1742;
and Bp. Patrick was a prolific writer till his death in
1707. May we not also claim the excellent and
learned Grabe as altogether one of ourselves?</p>

<p>Such names do not require special comment. They
are their own best eulogium, and present a high title
to their country's gratitude. The name of Prebendary
Lowth, (the author of an excellent commentary on
the prophets,) reminds us that there was living till
1732 one who fully appreciated the calling of an
Interpreter of God's Word<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Bishop Lowth his son,
in his great work, (1753,) recovered the forgotten
principle of Hebrew poetry. To convince ourselves
what a spirit existed in some quarters, (notwithstanding
the general spread of the very opinions which
'Essayists and Reviewers' have been so industriously
reproducing in our own day,) it is only necessary
to transcribe the title-page of S. Parker's excellent
'Bibliotheca Biblica,' a Commentary on the Pentateuch,
1720-1735; 'gathered out of the genuine
writings of Fathers, Ecclesiastical Historians, and Acts
of Councils down to the year of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> 451, being
that of the fourth General Council; and lower, as
occasion may require.'&mdash;That learned man designed to
achieve a Commentary on the whole Bible on the same
laborious plan; but his labours and his life, (at the age
of 50,) were brought to an end in 1730.&mdash;Dr. Waterland,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxvi" id="Page_cxxvi">[cxxvi]</a></span>born in 1683, and Dr. Jackson, born in 1686,&mdash;two
great names!&mdash;died respectively in 1740 and
1763.&mdash;In 1778, appeared Dr. Townson's admirable
'Discourses on the Gospels.' The author lived till
1792. Pious Bp. Horne (1730-1792) has left the
best evidence of his ability as a Divine in the Introduction
to his Commentary on the Psalms. Jones of
Nayland is found to have lived till 1800. Bp. Horsley,
a great champion of orthodoxy of belief, as well as
an excellent commentator, critic, and Sermon writer,
lived till 1806. Not seven years have elapsed since
there was to be seen among ourselves a venerable
Divine, who was declared in 1838, by the chief promoter
of the 'Tracts for the Times,' to have "been
reserved to report to a forgetful generation what was
the Theology of their Fathers<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>." Martin Joseph
Routh, died in 1854, after completing a century of
years. In 1832 appeared his 'Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum
Opuscula.' His 'Reliqu&aelig; Sacr&aelig;' had appeared
in 1814. The work was undertaken so far back as
1788. The last volume appeared in 1848, and concluded
with a <i>Catena</i> of authorities on the great
question which was denied by the unbelievers of the
last century, and <i>is</i> denied by the 'Essayists and
Reviewers' of this<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. Here then was one who had
borne steady witness in the Church of England to
what is her genuine Catholic teaching from a period
dating long before the birth of any one who was concerned
with the 'Tracts for the Times.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxvii" id="Page_cxxvii">[cxxvii]</a></span>
More ancient names present themselves as furnishing
exceptions to Mr. Pattison's dreary sentence.
From Abp. Potter and Leslie, down to Abp. Laurence
and Van Mildert,&mdash;how many might yet be specified!
We have not hitherto mentioned Abp. Leighton, who
died in 1684: Hickes, Johnson, and Brett, who survived
respectively till 1715, 1725, and 1743: the
truly apostolic Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man (1663-1755,)&mdash;a
name, by the way, which deserves far
more distinct and emphatic notice than can here be
bestowed upon it; and Nelson, the pious author of
'Fasts and Festivals,' who died in 1715. We had
good Iz. Walton, till 1683, and holy Ken till 1711.
Richard Hele, author of 'Select Offices,' (which appeared
in 1717,) is a name not forgotten in Heaven
certainly, though little known on Earth; while Kettlewell
and Scandret begin a Catena of which good
Bishop Jolly would be only one of the later links.
Meanwhile, the reader is requested to take notice that
there were many other excellent Divines of the period
under consideration, (as Long and Horbery;) men
who made no great figure indeed, but who were evidently
persons of great piety and sound judgment;
while their learning puts that of 'Essayists and Reviewers'
altogether to the blush.</p>

<p>But I have reserved for the last, a truly noble
name,&mdash;which Mr. Pattison, (with singular bad taste,
to say no worse,) mentions only to disparage. I allude
to Dr. Joseph Butler, Bishop of Durham; whose
'Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the
Constitution and Course of Nature,'&mdash;remains, at the
end of a century, unanswerable as an Apology,&mdash;unrivalled
as a text-book,&mdash;unexhausted as a mine
of suggestive thought. It may be convenient for an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxviii" id="Page_cxxviii">[cxxviii]</a></span>'Essayist and Reviewer' to declare that "the merit of
the Analogy lies in its want of originality." (p.&nbsp;286.)
There was not much originality perhaps in the remark
that an apple falls to the ground. Whatever the
faults of the Analogy, that work, under <span class="smcap">God</span>, <i>saved
the Church</i>. However "depressing to the soul" (p.&nbsp;293.)
of Mr. Pattison, it is nevertheless a book which will
invigorate Faith, and brighten Hope, and comfort
Charity herself,&mdash;long after the spot where he and
I shall sleep has been forgotten: long after our very
names will be hard to find.</p>

<p>Let me turn from this illustrious individual, to one
whose very name is perhaps unknown. One loves to
think that there are at all times plenty of good men,
who are doing <span class="smcap">God's</span> work in the world, in quiet
corners; but whose names do not perhaps rise to the
surface and emerge into notice, throughout the whole
of a long life. Conversely, how many must there be,
the blessing of whose example and influence has extended
down from the surface, (where perhaps it was
acknowledged and appreciated by all,) until it made
itself felt by the humblest units of a lowly country
parish!... The obscure village of Finmere, (in Oxfordshire,)
was so happy as to enjoy for its Rector,
from 1734 to 1771, the Rev. Thomas Long, M.A.,&mdash;"a
man," (says the Register,) "of the most exemplary
piety and charity." He presented to the church twelve
acres of land, "charging it with a yearly payment of
fifteen shillings to the Clerk, <i>as a recompense to him for
attending on the Fasts and Festivals</i>; and ordering sixpence
to be deducted from the payment, for each time
the Clerk failed to attend on those days,&mdash;unless let
by sickness." About ten years ago, there was found
in the hands of a labouring man at Finmere, a solitary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxix" id="Page_cxxix">[cxxix]</a></span>copy of a printed "Lecture," by this individual, "addressed
to the young persons" of the village, (1762,)
which begins as follows:&mdash;"I have usually, once
every three years, gone through a course of Lectures
upon the Catechism; but considering my age and
great infirmities, it is not very probable I should continue
this practice any longer. I am willing therefore,
as a small monument of my care and affection for you,
to print the last of these Lectures," &amp;c.... What
heart so dull as not to admit that men like this, (and
there were <i>many</i> of them!) are quite good enough to
redeem an age from indiscriminate opprobrium and
unmitigated contempt?</p>

<p>Shall we omit, after this enumeration, to notice the
singular fact that <i>Discipline</i> still lingered on,&mdash;even
the discipline of <i>public penance</i>,&mdash;until within the
memory of aged persons yet living? Merchants in
the city of London wore mourning during Lent, within
the present century. It is only within the last thirty
years that formul&aelig; expressive of reliance on the Divine
blessing have been expunged from bills-of-lading, and
similar printed documents. In the beginning of the
period discoursed of by Mr. Pattison, (viz. in the year
1714,) the excellent Robert Nelson, in "An Address
to Persons of Quality and Estate," proposed as objects
for the generosity of the affluent, such institutions as
the following:&mdash;"the creating of Charity Schools,"&mdash;of
"Parochial Libraries in the meanly endowed Cures
throughout England,"&mdash;of "a superior School for
training up Schoolmasters and Schoolmistresses,"&mdash;and
of "Colleges or Seminaries for the Candidates of Holy
Orders." He suggested that there should be "Houses
of Hospitality for entertaining Strangers;" "Suffragan
Bishops, both at home and in the Western Planta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxx" id="Page_cxxx">[cxxx]</a></span>tions;"
"Colleges for receiving Converts from Popery."
Some of Nelson's suggestions read like vaticinations.
He points out the need of Ladies' Colleges,&mdash;of
a Hospital for Incurables,&mdash;of Ragged Schools,
(for what else is a school "for the distressed children
called the <i>Black-guard</i>?"),&mdash;and of Houses of Mercy
for the reception of penitent fallen women.&mdash;Is it right
to speak of a century which could freely contemplate
such works as these and carry into execution many of
them<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, without some allusion to the leaven which was
at work beneath the dry crust of Society? the living
Catholic energy which neither the average dulness
of the pulpit could quench, nor the lifeless morality
which had been popularly substituted for Divinity
could destroy?</p>

<p>We are abundantly prepared therefore for Mr. Pattison's
admission that "public opinion was throughout
on the side of the defenders of Christianity:" (p.&nbsp;313:)&mdash;that,
"however a loose kind of Deism might be the
tone of fashionable circles, it is clear that distinct disbelief
of Christianity was by no means the general
state of the public mind. The leaders of the Low-Church
and Whig party were quite aware of this.
Notwithstanding the universal complaints of the High-Church
party of the prevalence of infidelity, it is obvious
that this mode of thinking was confined to a
very small section of society." (p.&nbsp;313.)</p>

<p>And surely it should not escape us that the peculiar
form which unbelief assumed during the period under
discussion, resulted in a benefit to the Church. "The
eighteenth century," (says our author,) "enforced the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxi" id="Page_cxxxi">[cxxxi]</a></span>truths of Natural Morality with a solidity of argument
and variety of proof which they have not received
since the Stoical epoch, if then." (p.&nbsp;296.)
"The career of the Evidential School, its success and
its failure, has enriched the history of Doctrine," not
indeed "with a complete refutation of that method as
an instrument of theological investigation," (p.&nbsp;297,)
(witness the immortal 'Analogy' of Bishop Butler!)&mdash;but,
certainly with very precious experience. That
age has bequeathed to the Church a vast body of controversial
writing which she could ill afford to part
with at the present day.</p>

<p>So far, we have little to complain of in Mr. Pattison's
Essay, except on the side of omission. <i>But</i>
for the fatal circumstance of the company in which
the learned writer comes abroad, and <i>the avowed purpose</i>
with which he is found there, a charitable construction
might have been put upon most of the present
performance. The following sentences, on the
other hand, are <i>not</i> excusable.</p>

<p>"In the present day when a godless orthodoxy
threatens, as in the fifteenth century, to extinguish
religious thought&nbsp;(!) altogether, and nothing is allowed
in the Church of England but the formul&aelig; of
past thinkings, which have long lost all sense of any
kind,&nbsp;(!) it may seem out of season to be bringing
forward a misapplication of common-sense in a bygone
age," (p.&nbsp;297.)</p>

<p>The "orthodoxy" of the fifteenth century is something
new to us. So is the prospect "in the present
day," of an "extinction of religious thought,"&mdash;the
result of "godless orthodoxy." The fault, or the
misfortune of the Church of England then, is, that she
retains "<i>the formul&aelig; of past thinkings, which have long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxii" id="Page_cxxxii">[cxxxii]</a></span>lost all sense of any kind</i>." (p.&nbsp;297.) If this does not
mean the English <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, what <i>does</i>
it mean? And if it <i>means</i> the English Prayer-Book,
how can Mr. Pattison retain his commission in the
Church of England, and exclusively employ a Book
which he presumes so to characterize?</p>

<p>But this is <i>ad hominem</i>. The learned writer proceeds:&mdash;"There
are times and circumstances when
religious ideas will be greatly benefited by being
submitted to the rough and ready tests by which busy
men try what comes in their way; by being made to
stand their trial, and be fully canvassed, <i>coram populo</i>.
As Poetry is not for the critics, so Religion is not for
the Theologians." (p.&nbsp;297.)</p>

<p>No doubt. But does Mr. Pattison then really mean
to tell us that the proper tribunal before which the
Creeds, (for example,) of the Catholic Church,&mdash;our
Communion and Baptismal offices,&mdash;the structure of
our Calendar, and so forth,&mdash;should "<i>stand their
trial</i>, and be <i>freely canvassed</i>," is, "<i>coram populo</i>?" A
"rough and ready test," this, of Truth, I grant; aye,
a <i>very</i> "rough" one. But was it ever,&mdash;can it ever
be,&mdash;a <i>fair</i> test? Let us hear Mr. Pattison out, on
the subject of Religion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When it is stiffened into phrases, and these phrases
are declared to be objects of reverence but not of intelligence,
it is on the way to become <i>a useless encumbrance;
the rubbish of the past; blocking the road</i>.
Theology then retires into the position it occupies in
the Church of Rome at present, an unmeaning frostwork
of dogma, out of all relation to the actual history
of Man." (pp.&nbsp;297-8.)</p>

<p>It cannot be necessary to discuss such sentiments.
With Mr. Pattison personally, I <i>will not</i> condescend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxiii" id="Page_cxxxiii">[cxxxiii]</a></span>to discuss them,&mdash;until he has divested himself of that
"useless encumbrance," and ceased to employ daily
"that rubbish of the past," which yet the two letters
he subjoins to his name indicate, in the most solemn
manner, his reverence for; and which alone make him
<i>Reverendus</i>.</p>

<p>But speaking to others,&mdash;speaking to <i>you</i>, my
friends,&mdash;let me point out that "the tendencies of
<i>irreligious</i> thought in England, 1860-1861," are <i>indeed</i>
in a direction where the Prayer-Book is found to
be <i>effectually</i> "blocking up the road." (pp.&nbsp;297-8.)
Mr. Pattison is simply dreaming,&mdash;haunted by the
phantoms of his own brain, and talking the language
of the den,&mdash;when he complains that "the Philosophy,
now petrified into tradition, may once have
been a vital Faith; but now that" it is "withdrawn
from public life," has ceased to be a "social influence."
(p.&nbsp;298.) And when he would exalt the last century
at the expence of the present, (pp.&nbsp;298-9,) he shews
nothing so much as the morbid state of his own imagination,&mdash;the
disordered condition of his own mind.
He has blinded himself; and he will not or he cannot
see in the healthier tone of our popular Divinity,&mdash;in
the increased attention to the study of Holy Scripture,&mdash;in
the impulse which Liturgical inquiries have
received since Wheatly's useful volume appeared;&mdash;or
again, in the immense number of Schools and
Churches which have been recently built,&mdash;in the
marvellous change for the better which has come over
the Clergy of the Church of England within the present
century,&mdash;in the vast development of our Colonial
Episcopate within the last few years,&mdash;in the rapid
increase of Institutions connected more or less directly
with the Church,&mdash;and I will add, in the conspicuous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxiv" id="Page_cxxxiv">[cxxxiv]</a></span>loyalty of the nation;&mdash;a practical refutation of his
own injurious insinuations; a blessed earnest that
God has <i>not</i> forsaken us; and that we shall <i>yet</i> be
a blessing to the World! The people of England, I
am persuaded, are in the main very sincerely attached
to their Prayer-Book. To them, it is not "a useless
encumbrance, the rubbish of the past, blocking the
road." Nay, there is a "rough and ready test" of
what is the current temper of the age in things religious,
to which I appeal with infinite satisfaction. I
mean, <i>the general burst of execration with which "Essays
and Reviews" have been received</i>, from one end of the
kingdom to the other. <i>The censure of all the Bishops</i>,
and of <i>both Houses of Convocation</i>; re-echoed, as it has
been, through <i>all ranks of the community</i>, is a great
fact;&mdash;a fact which I cordially recommend to Mr.
Pattison's attention, when he would philosophize on
the religious tendencies of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The age we live in, (Heaven knows!) has many
drawbacks. <i>What</i> age of the Church has <i>not</i> had
them? The fatal disposition which prevails to relax
all the ancient safeguards,&mdash;the desire to tamper yet
further with the Law of Marriage, and to desecrate
the Christian Sabbath,&mdash;these are grievous features
of the times; which may well occasion alarm and
create perplexity. But nothing of the kind should
ever make us despond; much less despair. There is
One above "who is over all, <span class="smcap">God</span> blessed for ever."
Shall we not rather seek to employ these advantages
which we have, with a single heart, a single eye to
<span class="smcap">God's</span> glory; and leave the issue, with a generous
confidence, to <i>Him</i>?... It was thus that the great
philosophic Divine of the last century comforted himself,
amid darker days than <i>we</i> shall ever experience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxv" id="Page_cxxxv">[cxxxv]</a></span>
"As different ages have been distinguished by different
sorts of particular errors and vices, the deplorable
distinction of ours," (he said,) "is an avowed
scorn of Religion in some, and a growing disregard to
it in the generality." "It is impossible for me, my
brethren,"&mdash;(Butler is still addressing the clergy of
his Diocese, 1761,)&mdash;"to forbear lamenting with you
the general decay of Religion in this nation; which is
now observed by every one, and has been for some
time the complaint of all serious persons. The influence
of it is more and more wearing out of the minds
of men;" while "the number of those who profess
themselves unbelievers, increases, and with their
number their zeal. Zeal, it is natural to ask,&mdash;for
what? Why truly <i>for</i> nothing, but <i>against</i> everything
that is sacred and good among us<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>." And yet,
in days dark as those, Piety could suggest that "no
Christian should possibly despair;" and Faith could
assign as the reason of this blessed confidence,&mdash;"<i>For
He who hath all power in Heaven and Earth, hath promised
that He will be with us to the end of the world.</i>"</p>

<p>It is time to dismiss Mr. Pattison's Essay. In
doing so, I will not waste my time and yours by carping
at the many errors of detail into which he has
(not inexcusably) fallen. These are the accidents,&mdash;not
the essence of his paper. The root of bitterness
with the Author is, clearly enough, <i>the Theory of Religious
Belief in the Church of England</i>. His concluding
words shew this plainly. The sting of the Essay
is in the tail:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the Catholic theory the feebleness of Reason is
met half-way, and made good by the authority of the
Church. When the Protestants threw off this authority,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxvi" id="Page_cxxxvi">[cxxxvi]</a></span>they did not assign to Reason what they took
from the Church, but to Scripture. Calvin did not
shrink from saying that Scripture 'shone sufficiently
by its own light.' As long as this could be kept to,
the Protestant theory of belief was whole and sound.
At least it was as sound as the Catholic. In both,
Reason, aided by spiritual illumination, performs the
subordinate function of recognising the supreme authority
of the Church, and of the Bible, respectively.
Time, learned controversy, and abatement of zeal,
drove the Protestants generally from the hardy but
irrational assertion of Calvin. Every foot of ground
that Scripture lost was gained by one or other of the
three substitutes: Church-authority, the Spirit, or Reason.
Church-authority was essayed by the Laudian
divines, but was soon found untenable, for on that
footing it was found impossible to justify the Reformation
and the breach with Rome." [O shame!] "The
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> then came into favour along with Independency.
But it was still more quickly discovered that
on such a basis only discord and disunion could be
reared. There remained to be tried Common Reason,
carefully distinguished from recondite learning, and
not based on metaphysical assumptions. To apply
this instrument to the contents of Revelation was the
occupation of the early half of the eighteenth century;
with what success has been seen. In the latter part
of the century the same Common Reason was applied
to the external evidences. But here the method fails
in a first requisite,&mdash;universality; for even the shallowest
array of historical proof requires some book-learning
to apprehend."&mdash;(pp.&nbsp;328-9.)</p>

<p>Now all this is discreditable to Mr. Pattison as a
Philosopher and as a Divine. <i>When</i> did Protestant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxvii" id="Page_cxxxvii">[cxxxvii]</a></span>England "throw off the authority" of the Church?&mdash;What
are <i>Calvin's</i> opinions to <i>her</i>?&mdash;How does 'Independency,'
'Rationalism,' or any other unsound principle,
affect <i>us</i>? Look at our Prayer-Book. Is it not
the same which it was from the beginning? The
Sarum Use, reformed and revised, has been our unbroken
heritage as Christian men, from the first. Essentially
remodelled in the days of Edward VI., the
recension of our "Laudian Divines" is, (by <span class="smcap">God's</span>
great mercy!) still ours. What other teaching but
that of <i>the Book of Common Prayer</i>, is, to this hour,
the authoritative teaching of the Church of England?
Why insinuate there has been vicissitude of Theory,
where notoriously there has been none? Why imply
that the storms which periodically sweep over the
citadel of our Zion are effectual to remove the old
foundations and to substitute new? What but a
hollow heartless Scepticism <i>can</i> be the result of such
an abominable passage as the foregoing?</p>

<p>"Whoever will take the religious literature of the
present day as a whole, and endeavour to make out
clearly on what basis Revelation is supposed by it to
rest, whether on Authority, on the Inward Light, on
Reason, on self-evidencing Scripture, or on the combination
of the four, or some of them, and in what proportions;
would probably find that he had undertaken
a perplexing but not altogether profitless inquiry."&mdash;(p.&nbsp;329.)
And so the Essay ends.</p>

<p>With a short comment on the proposed problem,
I also shall conclude.</p>

<p>No one but a fool would set about the task which
Mr. Pattison here proposes. The current "religious
literature <i>of the day</i>" cannot be supposed, for an instant,
to be an adequate exponent of the mind of the
Church of England,&mdash;or of any other Church. Reve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxviii" id="Page_cxxxviii">[cxxxviii]</a></span>lation
rests, at this hour, on exactly the same basis on
which it has always rested, and on which it will rest,
to the end of time; let the age be faithful, or faithless,&mdash;learned
or unlearned,&mdash;rationalizing or scientific,&mdash;sceptical
or superstitious,&mdash;or whatever else
you will. And if I am asked to explain myself, I
would humbly say,&mdash;(always submitting my own
statements in such a matter to the judgment of the
Bishops and Doctors of the Church of England,)&mdash;that
we receive the Bible on the authority of <i>the
Church</i>. The Church teaches us by the concurrent
voices of many Fathers, Doctors, Saints, how to interpret
the Bible; and convinces us that the three
Creeds which she delivers to us as her own independent
tradition, may be proved thereby; being in entire
conformity with Holy Scripture, though not originally
deduced from it. "Self-evidencing" is hardly
a correct epithet to bestow upon Scripture. And
yet, from the evidence which the New Testament supplies
to the Old, and from the interpretation which
it puts upon its teaching, we should not despair
of proving the Truth of Revelation, to one who had
neither darkened the inward Light, nor perverted
his Reason.</p>

<p>In truth, however, it is idle thus to speculate. We
have been born into the world during the nineteenth
Century, whether we wish it or not. We have been
nourished, (<span class="smcap">God</span> be thanked!) in the bosom of the
Christian Church, whether we would or no. The glory
of the Gospel has informed our natural reason, and we
cannot undo the blessed process, strive we as much as
we will. The "inward Light," (as we call it,) is the
lingering twilight of the Day of Creation, in the case
of the heathen,&mdash;the reflected ray of the noontide of
the Gospel, even in the case of the modern unbeliever.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxix" id="Page_cxxxix">[cxxxix]</a></span>We cannot escape from these conditions of our being,
although we may affect to ignore them, or pretend to
turn our eyes the other way. <i>No</i> help however is to
be rejected. <i>No</i> faculty of the soul need be denied the
privilege of assisting to convince the doubting heart.
The inward Light may not be disparagingly spoken
of: for what if it should prove to be a ray sent down
from the Father of Lights, to illumine the dark places
of the soul? The aid of Reason is not to be excluded;
for what is Faith but the highest dictate of the Reason?
Faith, (let us ever remember,) being opposed
not to <i>Reason</i>, but to <i>Sight</i>!... And who for a moment
supposes that we disparage the office of Reason,
because we speak of the authority of the Church, in
controversies of Faith? We simply proclaim the
Church to be the appointed witness and keeper of
Holy Writ; and when we are invited "<i>to make out
clearly</i> on what basis Revelation is supposed to rest,"
(p.&nbsp;329,) we point,&mdash;where else <i>should</i> we point?&mdash;unhesitatingly
to <i>her</i> unwavering witness from the
beginning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>VII. The Essay which brings up the rear in this
very guilty volume is from the pen of the "<span class="smcap">Rev.
Benjamin Jowett, M.A.</span>, [Fellow and Tutor of Balliol
College, and] Regius Professor of Greek in the University
of Oxford,"&mdash;"a gentleman whose high personal
character and general respectability seem to
give a weight to his words, which assuredly they do
not carry of themselves<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>." His performance is entitled
"<span class="smcap">On the Interpretation of Scripture</span>:" being,
in reality, nothing else but a laborious <i>denial of its
Inspiration</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxl" id="Page_cxl">[cxl]</a></span>
Mr. Jowett's quarrel is with the whole body of
Commentators on the Bible,&mdash;ancient and modern;
with the whole Church Catholic. He cannot endure
the claim of that Book, (like its Divine object and
Author,) to "a Name which is above every other
Name." That Plato and Sophocles should be capable
of but one method of Interpretation, and <i>that</i> the
literal,&mdash;while the Bible lays claim to a yet profounder
meaning,&mdash;so distresses the Regius Professor
of Greek, that he has appropriated to himself almost
a quarter of the present volume, in order that he may
cast laborious and systematic ridicule on the very
supposition. Some parts of his method I propose presently
to submit to <i>exactly the same "free handling"
which he has himself applied to <span class="smcap">the Word of God</span></i>. In the
meantime, since it is my intention not only to demonstrate
the worthlessness of the structure which Mr.
Jowett has with so much perverse industry here built
up, by an examination of some parts of it in detail,
but also to pull down as much of the fabric as I am
able within a small compass,&mdash;(the construction of
something which it is hoped will prove more durable,
being to be found in my IIIrd and IVth, Vth
and VIth Sermons,)&mdash;I proceed at once to inspect the
foundation-stone of his edifice; and briefly to demonstrate
its absolute insecurity.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Mr. Jowett's fundamental principle is expressed
in the following brief precept: "<i>Interpret the Scripture
like any other book.</i>" (p.&nbsp;377.) To this favourite tune,
(although he plays many intricate variations on it,)
he invariably reverts in the end<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. On this preliminary
postulate therefore, which, at first sight, to a candid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxli" id="Page_cxli">[cxli]</a></span>mind, seems fair enough, I proceed to remark as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Jowett's formula may be cheerfully and entirely
accepted,&mdash;<i>apart from the sinister glosses which he immediately
proceeds to put upon it</i>. By all means "Interpret
the Scripture like any other book." Let us
see to what result this principle will conduct us. As
for the formula itself, I take the liberty to assume
that it <i>ought to mean</i> somewhat as follows:&mdash;"Approach
the volume of Holy Scripture with the same
candour, and in the same unprejudiced spirit with
which you would approach any other famous book of
high antiquity. Study it with at least the same attention.
Give at least equal heed to all its statements.
Acquaint yourself at least as industriously with its
method, and with its principle; employing and applying
either, with at least equal fidelity, in its interpretation.
Above all, beware of playing tricks with its
plain language. Beware of suppressing any part of
the evidence which it supplies as to its own meaning.
Be truthful, and unprejudiced, and honest, and consistent,
and logical, and exact throughout, in your
work of Interpretation. '<span class="smcap">Interpret Scripture like
any other book.</span>'"</p>

<p>Now, (not to be tedious,) if <i>this</i> were Mr. Jowett's
principle, all further discussion would be at an end.
The general question of the right method of interpreting
the Bible would be easily settled; but it
would be hopelessly settled&mdash;<i>against the Regius Professor
of Greek</i>. As I have briefly shewn, (from
p.&nbsp;144 to p.&nbsp;160 of the present volume,) our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
and His Apostles openly and repeatedly claim for
Scripture that very depth of meaning, that very extent
of signification, which Mr. Jowett so strenuously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlii" id="Page_cxlii">[cxlii]</a></span>maintains that it does <i>not</i> possess.&mdash;This great fact,
he prudently takes no notice of. He simply ignores
it. Either he has overlooked it, through inadvertency:
or he has omitted it, as not perceiving its
force and bearing on the question: or he has disingenuously
kept it back. He must choose between
these three suppositions. If he has overlooked the
fact on which I lay so much stress,&mdash;he is a careless
and incompetent reader. If he has failed to see its
force and bearing on the question,&mdash;he is a weak and
illogical thinker. If he has deliberately suppressed
it, knowing its fatal power,&mdash;he is simply a dishonest
man. To prevent offence, I may as well state freely
that my entire conviction is that he is simply a weak
and illogical person. My warrant for this opinion is
especially the very sad performance of his now under
consideration.</p>

<p>It is clear however that the paraphrase above
hazarded does <i>not</i> express Mr. Jowett's principle.
"Interpret the Bible like any other book," means
with him something else. And what it <i>does</i> mean,
the Reverend author does not suffer us to doubt.
He shews that his meaning is, <i>Interpret the Bible
like any other book</i>, <span class="smcap">for</span> <i>it is like any other book</i>. I
proceed to shew that this <i>is</i> Mr. Jowett's meaning.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary however at once to introduce
to the reader's notice the main inference which, (as
already hinted,) flows from Mr. Jowett's favourite
position. "<i>Interpret</i> Scripture like any other book,"&mdash;he
says. His business is with <i>the Interpretation</i>
of "the Jewish and Christian Scriptures;" and he
begins by eagerly assuring us,&mdash;and is strenuous in
all that follows to make us believe,&mdash;(but simply on
<i>&agrave; priori</i> grounds!)&mdash;that "the true glory and note
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxliii" id="Page_cxliii">[cxliii]</a></span>of Divinity in these, is <i>not</i> that they have hidden,
mysterious, or double meanings; but <i>a simple and
universal one</i>, which is beyond them and will survive
them." (p.&nbsp;332.) "Is it admitted," (he asks, at the
end of many pages,) "that <i>the Scripture has one and
only one true meaning</i>?" (p.&nbsp;368.)</p>

<p>Let us hear what reasons the Reverend author of
this seventh Essay is able to produce in support of his
favourite opinion. He approaches the subject from
a respectful distance:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) "It is a strange, though familiar fact,"&mdash;(such
are the opening words of his Essay,)&mdash;"that great
differences of opinion exist respecting the Interpretation
of Scripture." (p.&nbsp;330.)&mdash;'Familiar,' the fact
is, certainly; but why 'strange?' A Book of many
ages,&mdash;of immense antiquity,&mdash;of most varied character,&mdash;treating
of the unseen world,&mdash;purporting
to be a mysterious composition,&mdash;and by all Christian
men believed to have <span class="smcap">God</span> for its true Author: a book
which has come into collision with every form of
human error, and has triumphed gloriously over every
form of human opposition:&mdash;<i>how</i> can it be thought
'strange' that the interpretation of such a book should
have provoked "great differences of opinion?" ...
Surely none but the weakest of thinkers, unless
committed to the assumption that <i>the Bible is like
any other book</i>, could ever have penned such a silly
remark.</p>

<p>(ii) "We do not at once see <i>the absurdity</i> of the
same words having many senses, or free our minds
from <i>the illusion</i> that the Apostle or Evangelist must
have written with a reference to the creeds or controversies
or circumstances of other times. Let it be
considered, then, that this extreme variety of inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxliv" id="Page_cxliv">[cxliv]</a></span>pretation
<i>is found to exist in the case of no other book,
but of the Scriptures only</i>." (p.&nbsp;334.)</p>

<p>But the "phenomenon" which Mr. Jowett represents
as "so extraordinary that it requires an effort
of thought to appreciate it," (<i>Ibid.</i>,) does not seem
at all extraordinary to any one who does not begin by
<i>assuming</i> that the Bible is "like any other book."&mdash;If
<i>the Bible be inspired</i>,&mdash;then all is plain!</p>

<p>(iii) "Who would write a bulky treatise about the
method to be pursued in interpreting Plato or Sophocles?"&mdash;asks
Mr. Jowett. (p.&nbsp;378.)&mdash;No one but
a fool!&mdash;is the obvious reply. Plato and Sophocles
are ordinary books; and therefore <i>are to be interpreted</i>
like any other book. The Bible not so, as we shall
see by and by. Again,&mdash;</p>

<p>(iv) "Each writer, each successive age, has characteristics
of its own, as strongly marked, or more
strongly, than those which are found in the authors
or periods of classical Literature. These differences
are not to be lost in <i>the idea of a Spirit from whom they
proceed, or by which they were overruled</i>. And therefore,
illustration of one part of Scripture by another should
be confined to writings of the same age and the same
authors, except where the writings of different ages or
persons offer obvious similarities. It may be said,
further, that illustration should be chiefly derived,
not only from the same author, <i>but from the same
writing, or from one of the same period of his life</i>. For
example, the comparison of St. John and the 'synoptic'
Gospels, or of the Gospel of St. John with the Revelation
of St. John, will tend <i>rather to confuse than to
elucidate the meaning of either</i>." (pp.&nbsp;382-3.)&mdash;But
really, in reply, it ought to suffice to point out that
the result of the Church's experience for 1800 years
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlv" id="Page_cxlv">[cxlv]</a></span>has been the very opposite of the Professor's. "<i>The
idea of a <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> from whom they proceeded</i>," is, to the
thoughtful part of mankind, <i>the only intelligible clue</i> to
the several books of Holy Scripture, from Genesis to
Revelation! Hence "the marginal references to the
English Bible," (to which Mr. Jowett devotes a depreciatory
half page,) so far from being the dangerous or
useless apparatus which he represents, we hold to be
an instrument of paramount importance for eliciting
the true meaning of Holy Writ.&mdash;In a word, he is
reasoning about the Bible on <i>the assumption</i> that the
Bible is <i>like any other book</i>.</p>

<p>(v) "To attribute to St. Paul or the Twelve the
abstract notion of Christian Truth which afterwards
sprang up in the Catholic Church ... is the same
error as to attribute to Homer the ideas of Thales or
Heraclitus, or to Thales the more developed principles
of Aristotle and Plato." (p.&nbsp;354.)&mdash;<i>Not if St. Paul and
the Twelve were inspired.</i></p>

<p>(vi) He bids us remark, with tedious emphasis, that
although the same philological and historical difficulties
which occur in Holy Scripture are found in
profane writings, yet "the meaning of classical authors
is known with comparative certainty; and the
interpretation of them seems to rest on a scientific
basis.... <i>Even the Vedas and the Zendavesta</i>, though
beset by obscurities of language probably greater than
are found in any portion of the Bible, are interpreted,
at least by European scholars, according to fixed rules,
and beginning to be clearly understood." (p.&nbsp;335.)</p>

<p>But at the end of several weak sentences, through
which the preceding fallacy is elongated into distressing
tenuity, <i>who</i> does not exclaim,&mdash;The supposed
"scientific" basis on which the interpretation of books
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlvi" id="Page_cxlvi">[cxlvi]</a></span>in general rests, is simply this; (&#945;) that being <i>merely
human</i>, and (&#946;) <i>not professing</i> to have any other than
their obvious literal meaning,&mdash;they are all interpreted
in the obvious ordinary way!</p>

<p>For (&#945;),&mdash;If any book were even <i>suspected</i> to be
Divine, the manner of interpreting it would of course
be different. Not that the "basis" of such Interpretation
would therefore cease to be "scientific!" Take
the only known instance of such a Book. The Bible
has been suspected&nbsp;(!) for 1800 years to be inspired.
How has it fared with the Bible?</p>

<p>The Science of Biblical Interpretation is one of the
noblest and best understood in the world. It has
been professed and practised in every country of
Christendom. The great Masters of this Science have
been such men as Hilary of Poictiers, Basil and the
two Gregories in Asia Minor, Epiphanius in Cyprus,
Ambrose at Milan, John Chrysostom at Antioch,
Jerome in Palestine, Augustine in Africa, Athanasius
and Cyril at Alexandria. The names descend in an
unbroken stream from the first four centuries of our
&aelig;ra down to the age of Andrewes, and Bull, and
Pearson, and Mill. These men all interpret Scripture
in one and the same way. Their principles are the
same throughout. They were all Professors of <i>the
same Sacred Science</i>.</p>

<p>But (&#946;),&mdash;If a book even <i>professes</i> to have a hidden
meaning, it is interpreted by a special set of canons.
Thus Dante's great poem<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> may not be read as Hume's
History of England is read.&mdash;To proceed, however.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlvii" id="Page_cxlvii">[cxlvii]</a></span>
(vii) Sophocles is perhaps the most subtle of the
ancient Greek poets. "Several schools of critics have
commented on his works. To the Englishman he has
presented one meaning, to the Frenchman another, to
the German a third; the interpretations have also differed
with the philosophical systems which the interpreters
espoused. To one the same words have appeared
to bear a moral, to another a symbolical meaning;
a third is determined wholly by the authority
of old commentators; while there is a disposition to
condemn the scholar who seeks to interpret Sophocles
from himself only and with reference to the ideas and
beliefs of the age in which he lived. And the error
of such an one is attributed not only to some intellectual
but even to a moral obliquity&nbsp;(!) which prevents
his seeing the true meaning." (p.&nbsp;336.)</p>

<p>It has fared with Sophocles therefore, (according to
Mr. Jowett,) <i>in all respects as it has fared with the
Bible</i>. "It would be tedious," (he justly remarks,)
"to follow the absurdity which has been supposed
into details. By such methods," Sophocles or Plato
might "be made to mean anything." (p.&nbsp;336.)</p>

<p>But who does not perceive that the obvious way to
escape from the supposed difficulty, is to remember
that <i>neither Sophocles nor Plato was inspired</i>!...
Mr. Jowett's difficulty is occasioned by his assumption
that <i>the Bible stands on the same level as Plato
and Sophocles</i>.</p>

<p>(viii) Again,&mdash;"If it is not held to be a thing impossible
that there should be agreement in the meaning
of <i>Plato and Sophocles</i>, neither is it to be regarded
as absurd, that there should be a like agreement in
the interpretation of <i>Scripture</i>?" (p.&nbsp;426.)&mdash;The whole
force of this argument clearly consisting in the strictly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlviii" id="Page_cxlviii">[cxlviii]</a></span>equal claims of these books to Inspiration.&mdash;Elsewhere,
Mr. Jowett expresses the same thing more
unequivocally:&mdash;The old "explanations of Scripture,"
(he says,) "are no longer tenable. They belong to
a way of thinking and speaking which was once diffused
over the world, but has now passed away."
Having quietly <i>assumed</i> all this, the Reverend writer
proceeds:&mdash;"And what we give up as a general
principle, we shall find it impossible to maintain
partially; <i>e.g.</i> in the types of the Mosaic Law, and
the double meanings of Prophecy, at least <i>in any sense
in which it is not equally applicable to all deep and suggestive
writings</i>." (p.&nbsp;419.)</p>

<p>(ix) "Still one other supposition has to be introduced,
which will appear, perhaps, <i>more extravagant
than any which have preceded</i>. Conceive then that
these modes of interpreting Sophocles&nbsp;(!) had existed
for ages; that great institutions and interests had
become interwoven with them; and in some degree
even the honour of Nations and Churches;&mdash;is it too
much to say that, in such a case, they would be
changed with difficulty, and that they would continue
to be maintained long after critics and philosophers
had seen that they were indefensible?" (pp.&nbsp;336-7.)</p>

<p>I suppose we may at once allow Mr. Jowett most
of what he asks. We may freely grant that if the
Tragedies of Sophocles <i>had</i> exercised the same wondrous
dominion over the world which the Books of
the Bible have exercised:&mdash;if [OE]dipus and Jocasta
and Creon; if Theseus and Dejanira and Hercules;
if Ajax, Ulysses and Minerva;&mdash;<i>had</i> done for the
world what Enoch and Noah;&mdash;what Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob;&mdash;what Joseph, and Joshua, and Hannah,
and Samuel, and David;&mdash;what Elijah and Elisha;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlix" id="Page_cxlix">[cxlix]</a></span>what Isaiah and Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, and
the rest;&mdash;what St. Peter, and St. John, and St. Paul;&mdash;what
the Blessed Virgin and her name-sakes, have
done:&mdash;In a word: had Homer's gods and heroes
altogether changed the face of society, and revolutionized
the world; <i>so that "great institutions and interests
had become interwoven with them, and in some degree
even the honour of Nations and Churches</i>;" (p.&nbsp;336;)&mdash;if,
I repeat, all this <i>had</i> really and actually taken
place;&mdash;<i>great</i> "difficulty" would, no doubt, (as Mr.
Jowett profoundly suggests,) be experienced, at the
end of 2000 years, in getting rid of them.</p>

<p>But since it unfortunately happens that <i>they have
done nothing of the kind</i>, we do not seem to be called
upon to follow the Regius Professor of Greek into the
supposed consequences of what he admits to be an
"extravagant supposition;" and which we humbly
think is an excessively foolish one also.</p>

<p>When, however, the Reverend Author of this speculation
establishes it as <i>a parallel with what has taken
place with regard to the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>, we tell him
plainly that his insinuation that "critics and philosophers
are maintaining the present mode of interpreting
Scripture <i>long after they have seen that it is indefensible</i>"&mdash;is
a piece of impertinence which seems to require
a public apology. A man may retain Orders in
the Church of England, if he pleases, while yet he
repudiates her doctrines: may declare that he subscribes
her Articles <i>ex animo</i>, and yet seem openly to
deny them. But he has no right whatever to impute
corresponding baseness to others. The charge should
be either plainly made out, or openly retracted<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cl" id="Page_cl">[cl]</a></span>
By such considerations then does Professor Jowett
attempt to shew that we ought to "interpret Scripture
like any other book." The gist of his observations,
in every case, is one and the same,&mdash;namely,
from <i>&agrave; priori</i> considerations to insinuate that <i>the Bible
is not essentially unlike any other book.</i></p>

<p>Now, quite apart from its Inspiration,&mdash;which is,
obviously, <span class="smcap">the</span> one essential respect wherein the Bible
is wholly unlike every other book in the world; (inasmuch
as, if it is inspired, it differs from every other
book <i>in kind</i>; stands among Books as the Incarnate
<span class="smcap">Word</span> stood among Men,&mdash;<i>quite alone</i>; notwithstanding
that He spoke their language, shared their wants,
and accommodated Himself to their manners;)&mdash;<i>apart</i>,
I say, <i>from the fact of its Inspiration</i>, it is not difficult
to point out several particulars in which the Bible is
<i>utterly unlike any other Book which is known to exist</i>;
and therefore to suggest an <i>&agrave; priori</i> reason why <i>neither
should it be interpreted</i> like any other book.</p>

<p>1. The Bible then contains in all (66-9=) 57
distinct writings,&mdash;the work of perhaps upwards of
forty different Authors<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. Yet, for upwards of fifteen
centuries those many writings have been all collected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cli" id="Page_cli">[cli]</a></span>into one volume: and, for a large portion of that
interval, on the writings so collected the Church
Universal has agreed in bestowing the name of <i>the
Book</i>,&mdash;&#954;&#945;&#964;' &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;,&mdash;<span class="smcap">the Bible</span>.</p>

<p>2. The Bible is divided into two parts, which are
severed by an interval of upwards of four centuries.
On these two great divisions of the Bible, respectively,
has been bestowed the title of the Old and the New
Covenant. And, what is remarkable,&mdash;<i>The same phenomena
which are observable in respect of the whole Bible,
are observable in respect of either of its parts.</i> Thus,</p>

<p>(&#945;) The several writings of which the Old Testament
is composed,&mdash;(39-3=) 36 in all<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, are by
many different hands: those of the New Testament,
in like manner,&mdash;(27-6=) 21 in all, are by eight
different authors.</p>

<p>(&#946;) Those many writings of the Old Testament are
found to have been collected into a single volume
about four hundred years before the Christian &aelig;ra;
when they were denominated by a common name,
&#7969; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8053;,&mdash;"<i>The Scripture</i><a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>;" and the supreme authority
of the writings so collected together, was axiomatic<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.
One arguing with His Hebrew countrymen
was able to appeal to a place in the Psalms, and to
remind them parenthetically that "the Scripture <i>cannot
be broken</i><a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>,"&mdash;that is, might not be gainsaid,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clii" id="Page_clii">[clii]</a></span>doubted, explained away, or set aside.&mdash;Precisely
similar phenomena are observable in respect of the
writings of the New Testament.</p>

<p>(&#947;) Although the books of the Old Covenant are
scattered at intervals over the long period of upwards
of a thousand years, the writers of the later books are
observed to quote the earlier ones, as if by a peculiar
secret sympathy: now, incorporating long passages,&mdash;now,
simply adapting one or two sentences,&mdash;now,
blending allusive references. For some proof of this
assertion, (as far as I am able to produce it at a
moment's notice,) the reader is referred to the foot
of the page<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>The self-same phenomenon is observable with regard
to the New Testament Scriptures. Although all the
books were written within so short a space as about
fifty years, the later writers quote the earlier ones
to a surprising extent. In the Gospels, the Gospels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cliii" id="Page_cliii">[cliii]</a></span>are quoted times without number. In the Epistles,
the Gospels are cited, or referred to, upwards of sixty
times. The Epistles contain many references to the
Epistles.&mdash;The phenomenon thus alluded to will also
be found insisted upon in a later part of the present
volume<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

<p>"The fact, I believe, on close examination, will be
found to stand thus:&mdash;The Holy Bible abounds in
quotations, even more perhaps than most other books;
but they are introduced in a way which is peculiar
to Revelation, and its own. When a Prophet or Apostle
mentions one of his own holy brethren, as when
Ezekiel names Daniel, or Daniel Jeremiah; when St.
Peter speaks of St. Paul, or St. Paul of St. Peter, or
of St. Luke the Physician; <i>when they mention them,
they do not quote them; and when they quote them, they
do not mention them</i><a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>."</p>


<p><a name="Page_cliii_Section_delta" />(&#948;) The later writer in the Old Testament who quotes
some earlier portion of narrative is often observed
to supply independent information,&mdash;entering into
minute details and particulars which are not to be
found in the earlier record.&mdash;Now, "with the same
Almighty <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> for their guide, what was it to be
expected that the historians of our Blessed <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
would do? What, but the very thing which they
have done? that they would walk in the path, which
the holy Prophets of old had marked out? that they
would often tread full in each other's steps; often
relate the same miracle, or discourse, or parts of it, in
the words of the same prior writer; sometimes compress,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cliv" id="Page_cliv">[cliv]</a></span>sometimes expand; always shew to the diligent
inquirer, that they did not derive their information,
even of facts which they relate in another's words,
from him whom they copy, but wrote with antecedent
plenitude of knowledge and truth in themselves;
without staying to inform us whether what they deliver
is told for the first time, or has its place already
in authentic history<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>."</p>

<p>(&#949;) It may be worth remarking that though <i>the
Inspiration</i> of no part of either Testament has ever
been doubted in the Church, there do exist doubts
as to the <i>Authorship</i> of more than one of the Books
of the Old Testament; and <i>one</i> Book in the New,
(the Epistle to the Hebrews,) has been suspected by
some orthodox writers <i>not</i> to have been from the pen
of St. Paul, but to have been the work of some other
inspired and Apostolic writer.</p>

<p>(&#950;) History, Didactic matter, and Prophecy,&mdash;is
found to be the subject of either Testament.</p>

<p>(&#951;) In the New Testament, as in the Old, we are
presented with the singular phenomenon of more than
one Book being in a manner <i>copied</i> from another,&mdash;yet
with the addition of much independent original
matter. It is superfluous to name Samuel, Kings, and
Chronicles, on one side,&mdash;and the Gospels on the other.
To the Gospels may be added the Second Epistle of
St. Peter and the Epistle of St. Jude.</p>

<p>(&#952;) Lastly, the same <i>modest</i> use of the Supernatural
is to be found in either Testament.&mdash;In both, the
writers are observed to pass without effort, and as it
were unconsciously, from revelations of the most stupendous
character, to statements of the simplest and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clv" id="Page_clv">[clv]</a></span>most ordinary kind<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.&mdash;In both, there is the same
prominence given to individual characters<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>; the same
occasional minuteness of detail where it might have
been least expected<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<p>3. But by far the most remarkable phenomenon remains
to be noticed; namely, the immense number
of quotations, (so far more numerous than is commonly
suspected,)&mdash;extending in length from a single word
to nearly a hundred and fifty<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>,&mdash;together with allusive
references, literally without number, which are
found in the New Testament Scriptures; <i>the writings
of the elder Covenant being in every instance, exclusively<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>,
the source of those quotations,&mdash;the object of
those allusions</i>.</p>

<p>4. When the nature of these quotations, references,
and allusions is examined with care, several extraordinary
phenomena present themselves, which it
seems impossible to consider without the deepest interest,
surprise, and admiration. Thus,&mdash;(i.) The
New Testament writers, on repeated occasions, display
<i>independent knowledge</i> of the Old Testament History
to which they make reference<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. The following
instances occur to my memory:&mdash;All the later links
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clvi" id="Page_clvi">[clvi]</a></span>in our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Genealogy<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>; the second Cainan<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>: Salmon's

in Heb. ix. 4: Abraham's purchase of Sychem<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>;
and a few other things<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.</p>

<p>(ii.) The same New Testament writers are observed
to handle the Old Testament Scriptures with an air
of singular authority, and to exercise an extraordinary
license of quotation; inverting clauses,&mdash;paraphrasing
statements,&mdash;abridging or expanding;&mdash;and always
without apology or explanation;&mdash;as if they were
conscious that they were dealing with <i>their own</i>.</p>

<p>(iii.) Most astonishing of all, obviously, as well as
most important, is <i>the purpose</i> for which the Evangelists
and Apostles of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> make their appeal
to the Old Testament Scriptures; invariably in order <i>to
establish some part of the Christian Revelation</i>. "Every
thoughtful student of the Holy Scriptures has been
struck with the circumstance which I now allude to:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clvii" id="Page_clvii">[clvii]</a></span>the freedom, namely, with which the inspired Writers
of the New Testament appeal back to the Old; and
see in it, as its one proper theme, the Christian subject.
They find themselves in that place, at length,
to which former intimations had pointed, and recognize
the connexion which they themselves have with
their ancient forerunners<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>." ... It is as if for four
hundred years and upwards, a mighty mystery,&mdash;described
in many a dark place of Prophecy, exhibited
by many a perplexing type, foreshadowed by many
a Divine narrative,&mdash;had waited for solution. The
world is big with expectation. The long-expected
time at last arrives. Up springs the Sun of Righteousness
in the Heavens; and lo, the cryptic characters
of the Law flash at once into glory, and the dark
Oracles of ancient days yield up their wondrous
meanings! "<span class="smcap">God</span>, who at sundry times and in divers
manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the
Prophets,"&mdash;in these last days speaks "unto us by
His <span class="smcap">Son</span>:" and lo, a chorus of Apostolic voices is
heard bearing witness to the Advent of "the Desire
of all nations!" ... Such is the relation which the
New Testament bears to the Old: such the true nature
of the many quotations from the earlier Scriptures,
which are found in the later half of the One
inspired Volume.</p>

<p>5. And thus we are led naturally to notice the
extraordinary connexion which subsists between the
two Testaments. "For what is the Law," (asks
Justin, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 140,) "but the Gospel foretold? or what
is the Gospel, but the Law fulfilled<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>?" "The contents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clviii" id="Page_clviii">[clviii]</a></span>of the Old and New Testament are the same," remarks
Augustine: "<i>there</i> foreshadowed, <i>here</i> revealed:
<i>there</i> prefigured, <i>here</i> made plain." "In the Old
Testament there is a concealing of the New: in the
New Testament there is a revealing of the Old<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>."&mdash;Mr.
Jowett's inquiry,&mdash;"If we assume the New Testament
as <i>a tradition running parallel with the Old</i>, may
not the Roman Catholic assume with equal reason a
tradition parallel with the New?" (p.&nbsp;381.)&mdash;shews
a truly childish misapprehension of the entire question.
The New Testament is not a "parallel tradition" at
all; but a <i>subsequent Revelation from Heaven</i>.</p>

<p>6. Now I might pursue these remarks much further:
for it would be well worth while to exhibit
what an extraordinary sameness of imagery, similarity
of allusion, and unity of purpose, runs through the
writings of either Covenant;&mdash;phenomena which can
only be accounted for in one way. This subject will
be found dwelt upon elsewhere; and to what has
been already delivered, I must be content here to
refer the reader<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>(Mr. Jowett himself has been struck by the phenomenon
thus alluded to: but after hinting at "some
natural association" as having suggested the language
of the Prophets, he proceeds: "We are not therefore
justified in supposing any hidden connexion in
the prophecies where [the prophetic symbols] occur.
<i>Neither is there any other ground for assuming design of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clix" id="Page_clix">[clix]</a></span>any other kind in Scripture; any more than in Plato or
Homer.</i>" (p.&nbsp;381.) ... And thus our philosopher, assuming
at the outset that the Bible is an uninspired
book, is for ever coming back to the lie with which
he set out. But to proceed.)</p>

<p>7. Still better worthy of notice, in this connexion,
is the singular fact (which will also be found adverted
to in another place<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>,) that the Old and New
Testaments alike profess to be a History of <i>Earthly</i>
events from a <i>Heavenly</i> point of view. The writers
of either Covenant claim to know <i>what <span class="smcap">God</span> did</i><a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>; how
characters and events appeared <i>in His sight</i><a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>: they
profess to find themselves in a familiar, and altogether
extraordinary relation with the unseen world<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>. Thus,
Moses begins the Bible with an august account of the
great Six Days,&mdash;when <span class="smcap">God</span> was alone in Creation;
the unwitnessed Agent, and Author of all things:&mdash;while
St. John the Divine, concluding the inspired
Canon, relates that he was "in the Spirit on the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Day;" and heard behind him "a great Voice,
as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the
first and the last<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>." ... "The general design of Scripture,"
(says Bishop Butler,) "may be said to be, to
give us an account of the World, in this one single
view,&mdash;<i>as <span class="smcap">God's</span> World: by which it appears essentially
distinguished from all other books, as far as I have found,
except such as are copied from it</i><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>."</p>

<p>8. And <i>yet</i> the grand external characteristic feature
of the Bible remains unnoticed! The one distinctive
feature of the Bible, is <i>this</i>,&mdash;that the four-fold Gospel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clx" id="Page_clx">[clx]</a></span><i>as a matter of fact</i>, exhibits to us, the <span class="smcap">Word</span> "made
flesh:" and, (O marvel of marvels!) suffers us to hear
His voice, and look upon His form, and observe His
actions. It does more. The New Testament professes
to be, and is, the complement of the Old. The promise
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, solemnly, and repeatedly,&mdash;"at sundry
times and divers manners,"&mdash;given in the one,
is fulfilled in the other. Henceforth they are no more
twain, for they have been by <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself joined
together; and the subject of both is none other than
our <span class="smcap">Saviour, Jesus Christ</span>.</p>

<p>Enough surely has been already adduced to warrant
a reasonable man in refusing to accept Professor
Jowett's repeated asseveration that the Bible is "to
be interpreted like any other book." A Book which
proves on examination to be so <i>wholly unlike every other
book</i>,&mdash;so entirely <i>sui generis</i>,&mdash;may surely well create
an <i>&agrave; priori</i> suspicion that it is not to be interpreted
either, after any ordinary fashion. But the grand
consideration of all is <i>still</i> behind! The <i>one</i> circumstance
which effectually refutes the view of the Reverend
Professor, remains yet to be specified; namely,
that <span class="smcap">the Bible professes to be inspired by the
Holy Spirit</span>. The <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> is again and again
declared <i>to speak</i> therein, &#948;&#953;&#8049;, "<i>by the instrumentality</i>,"
"<i>by the mouth</i>," of Man. In other words, <i><span class="smcap">God</span>, not
Man, professes to be the Author of the Bible</i>!</p>

<p>That the Bible <i>does</i> set up for itself such a claim,
will be found established at p.&nbsp;53 to p.&nbsp;57 of the present
volume. Professor Jowett's assurance that "for
any of the higher or supernatural views of Inspiration,
<i>there is no foundation in the Gospels or Epistles</i>,"
(p.&nbsp;345,)&mdash;must therefore be regarded as an extraordinary,
or rather as an unpardonable oversight on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxi" id="Page_clxi">[clxi]</a></span>his part. One would have thought that a single
saying, like that in Acts iii. 18 and 21, would have
occurred to his memory, and been sufficient to refute
him. Other places will be found quoted at p. cxcvii.</p>

<p>Very much is it to be feared however that the same
gentleman has overlooked a consideration of at least
equal importance; namely, the inevitable <i>inference</i>
from the discovery that the origin of the Bible is
Divine. He informs us that,&mdash;"It will be a further
assistance&nbsp;(!) in the consideration of this subject, to
observe that the Interpretation of Scripture has <i>nothing
to do with any opinion respecting its origin</i>." (p.
350.) "The <i>meaning</i> of Scripture," (he proceeds,)
"is one thing: the <i>Inspiration</i> of Scripture is another."&mdash;True.
But when we find the Reverend Author
insisting, again and again, that "it may be laid
down that Scripture has <i>one</i> meaning,&mdash;<i>the meaning
which it had to the mind of the Prophet or Evangelist
who first uttered, or wrote it</i>," (p.&nbsp;378,)&mdash;we
are constrained to remind him that, "To say that
the Scriptures, and the things contained in them, can
have no other or farther meaning than those persons
thought or had, who first recited or wrote them; is
evidently saying, <i>that those persons were the original,
proper, and sole authors of those books</i>, i.e. <span class="smcap">that they
are not inspired</span><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>." So that, in point of fact, <i>the
origin</i> of Holy Scripture, so far from being a consideration
of no importance, (as Mr. Jowett supposes,)
proves to be a consideration of the most vital importance
of all. And <i>the Interpretation</i> of Scripture, so far
from having "<i>nothing to do</i> with any opinion respecting
its origin," is affected by it most materially, or
rather depends upon it altogether!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxii" id="Page_clxii">[clxii]</a></span>
On a review of all that goes before, it will, I think,
appear plain to any person of sound understanding,
that Professor Jowett's <i>&agrave; priori</i> views respecting the
Interpretation of Holy Scripture will not stand the
test of exact reason. To suggest as he has done that
the Bible is to be interpreted like any other book, on
the plea that it <i>is</i> like any other book, is to build upon
a false foundation. His syllogism is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If the Bible is a book like any other book, the Bible
is to be interpreted like any other book.</p>

<p>The Bible is a book like any other book.</p>

<p>Therefore,&mdash;</p></div>

<p>But it has been shewn that the learned Professor's
minor premiss is false. It has been proved that the
Bible is <span class="smcap">not</span> a book like any other book.</p>

<p>Nay, I claim to have done <i>more</i>. I claim to have
established the contradictory minor premiss. The syllogism
therefore will henceforth stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If the Bible can be shewn to be a book like no
other book, but entirely <i>sui generis</i>, and claiming
to be the work of Inspiration,&mdash;then is it reasonable
to expect that it will have to be interpreted
like no other book, but entirely after a
fashion of its own.</p>

<p>But the Bible <i>can</i> be shewn to be a book like no
other book; entirely <i>sui generis</i>; and claiming to
be the work of Inspiration.</p>

<p>Therefore,&mdash;</p></div>

<p><b>2.</b> It remains however, now, to advance an important
step.&mdash;Mr. Jowett, in a certain place, adopts a
principle, the soundness of which I am able, happily,
entirely to admit. "Interpret Scripture from itself,&mdash;like
any other book about which we know almost nothing
except what is derived from its pages." (p.&nbsp;382.)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxiii" id="Page_clxiii">[clxiii]</a></span>"<i>Non nisi ex Scriptur&acirc; Scripturam interpretari potes.</i>"
(p.&nbsp;384.)</p>

<p>Scarcely has he made this important admission
however, and enunciated his golden Canon of interpretation,
when he hastens to nullify it. His very
next words are,&mdash;"The meaning of the Canon is only
this,&mdash;'That we cannot understand Scripture without
becoming familiar&nbsp;(!) with it.'"</p>

<p>But, (begging the learned writer's pardon,) so far
from <i>that</i> being the whole of the meaning of the
Canon, his gloss happens exactly to miss the only important
point. The plain meaning of the words,&mdash;"Only
out of the Scriptures can you explain the
Scriptures,"&mdash;is obviously rather this:&mdash;'That in
order <i>to interpret</i> the Bible, our aim must be to <i>ascertain
how the Bible interprets itself</i>.' In other words,&mdash;'Scripture
must be made <i>its own Interpreter</i>.' More
simply yet, in the Professor's own words, (from which,
<i>more suo</i>, he has imperceptibly glided away,)&mdash;"<i>Interpret
Scripture from itself.</i>" (p.&nbsp;382.) ... How then
does Scripture interpret Scripture? <i>That</i> is the only
question! for the answer to this question must be
held to be decisive as to the other great question
which Mr. Jowett raises in the present Essay,&mdash;namely,
How are <i>we</i> to interpret Scripture?</p>

<p>Now this whole Inquiry has been conducted elsewhere;
and will be found to extend from p.&nbsp;144 to
p.&nbsp;160 of the present volume. It has been there established,
by a sufficiently large induction of examples,
that <i>the Bible is to be interpreted as no other book
is, or can be interpreted</i>; and for the plain reason, that
<i>the inspired Writers themselves</i>, (our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself at
their head!) <i>interpret it after an altogether extraordinary
fashion</i>. Mr. Jowett's statement at p.&nbsp;339 that "the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxiv" id="Page_clxiv">[clxiv]</a></span>mystical interpretation of Scripture originated in the
Alexandrian age," is simply false.</p>

<p>And in the course of this proof, (necessarily involved
in it, in fact,) it has been incidentally shewn that the
sense of Scripture is not, by any means, invariably
<i>one</i>; and <i>that</i> sense the most obvious to those who
wrote, heard, or read it. It has been fully shewn
that the office of the Interpreter is <i>not</i>, by any means,
(as Mr. Jowett imagines,) "to recover the meaning of
the words <i>as they first struck on the ears, or flashed before
the eyes of those who heard or read them</i>." (p.&nbsp;338.)
The Reverend writer's repeated assertion that "we
have no reason to attribute to the Prophet or Evangelist
any second or hidden sense different from that
which appears on the surface," (p.&nbsp;380,) has been
fully, and as it is hoped effectually refuted.</p>

<p>And here I might lay down my pen. For since, at
the end of 74 pages, the Professor thus delivers himself,
(in a kind of imitation of St. Paul's language<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>,)&mdash;"Of
what has been said, this is the sum,&mdash;That
Scripture, <i>like other books</i>, has <i>one</i> meaning, which has
to be gathered from itself ... <i>without regard to &agrave;
priori notions about its nature and origin</i>:" that, "It
is to be interpreted <i>like other books</i>, with attention to
the prevailing state of civilization and knowledge,"
and so forth; (p.&nbsp;404;)&mdash;it must suffice to say that,
having established the very opposite conclusion, I
claim to have effectually answered his Essay; because
I have overthrown what he admits to be "the sum"
of it. Let me be permitted however&mdash;before I proceed
to review some other parts of his performance,&mdash;in
the briefest manner, not so much to recapitulate, as
to exhibit 'the sum' of what has been hitherto delivered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxv" id="Page_clxv">[clxv]</a></span>on the other side; in somewhat different language,
and as it were from a different point of view.</p>

<p>We are presented then, in the New Testament Scriptures,
with the august spectacle of the Ancient of Days
holding the entire volume of the Old Testament Scriptures
in His Hands, <i>and interpreting it of Himself</i>.
He, whose Life and Death are set forth in the Gospel;&mdash;whose
Church's early fortunes are set forth historically
in the Acts, while its future prospects are
shadowed prophetically in the Apocalypse;&mdash;whose
Doctrines, lastly, are explained in the twenty-one Epistles
of St. Paul and St. Peter, St. James and St. John
and St. Jude:&mdash;He, the Incarnate <span class="smcap">Word</span>, who was "in
the beginning;" who "was with <span class="smcap">God</span>," and who "was
<span class="smcap">God</span>:"&mdash;that same Almighty One, I repeat, is exhibited
to us in the Gospel, repeatedly, holding the
Volume of the Old Testament Scriptures in His Hands,
and <i>explaining it of Himself. "To day is this Scripture
fulfilled</i> in your ears<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>,"&mdash;was the solemn introductory
sentence with which, in the Synagogue of Nazareth,
(after closing the Book and giving it again to the
Minister,) He prefaced His Sermon from the lxist
chapter of Isaiah.&mdash;"Had ye believed Moses, ye would
have believed Me: <i>for he wrote of Me</i><a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>,"&mdash;"'O fools,
and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have
spoken! Ought not <span class="smcap">Christ</span> to have suffered these
things, and to enter into His glory?' And <i>beginning
at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in
all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself</i><a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>."&mdash;"These
are the words which I spake unto you, that
all things must be fulfilled <i>which are written in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxvi" id="Page_clxvi">[clxvi]</a></span>Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms,
concerning Me</i><a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Christ</span> was before Moses. The Gospel was not
made for the Law; but the Law was made for the
Gospel. The Gospel is not based on the Law, but the
Law is a shadow of the Gospel. In order to believe
the Bible, we must look upward; and fix our eyes on
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, sitting in Heavenly Glory, holding both
Testaments in His Hand; sealing both Testaments
with His seal; and delivering both Testaments as
Divine Oracles, to the World. We must receive the
<i>written Word</i> from the Hands of the <span class="smcap">Incarnate Word</span><a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>."</p>

<p>This august spectacle, let it be clearly stated,&mdash;(1)&nbsp;Establishes,
beyond all power of contradiction, the
intimate connexion which subsists between the Old
and the New Testament; as well as the altogether
unique relation which the one bears to the other:&mdash;(2)&nbsp;Invests
either Testament with a degree of sacred
importance and majestic grandeur which altogether
makes the Bible <i>unlike "any other book</i>:"&mdash;(3)&nbsp;Proves
that the Bible is to be interpreted as no other book
ever was, or ever can be interpreted:&mdash;(4)&nbsp;Demonstrates
that it has <i>more than a single meaning</i>:&mdash;and
lastly, Convincingly shews that <i><span class="smcap">God</span>, and not Man,
is its true Author</i>.</p>

<p>It will of course be asked,&mdash;Then does Mr. Jowett
take no notice at all of this vast and complicated problem?
How does he treat of the relation between the
Old Testament and the New?... He despatches the
entire subject in the following passage:&mdash;"The question,"
(he says,) "runs up into a more general one,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxvii" id="Page_clxvii">[clxvii]</a></span>'the relation between the Old and New Testaments.'
For the Old Testament <i>will receive a different meaning
accordingly as it is explained from itself, or from the
New</i>." (Very different certainly!) "In the first case,&mdash;a
careful and conscientious study of each one for
itself is all that is required." (That is to say, it will
not be explained at all!) "In the second case,&mdash;<i>the
types and ceremonies of the Law, perhaps the very
facts and persons of the history</i>, <span class="smcap">WILL BE ASSUMED</span>&nbsp;(!) to
be predestined or made after a pattern corresponding
to the things that were to be in the latter days."
(p.&nbsp;370.) (And why not "<i>will be found</i> to be replete
with Christian meaning,&mdash;full of lofty spiritual significancy?"&mdash;the
<i>proved</i> marvellousness of their texture,
the <i>revealed</i> mysteriousness of their purpose, being
an effectual refutation of all Mr. Jowett's <i>&agrave; priori</i>
notions!)</p>

<p>"And this question," (he proceeds,) "stirs up
another question respecting the Interpretation of the
Old Testament in the New. Is such Interpretation
to be regarded as the meaning of the original text, or
<i>an accommodation of it to the thoughts of other times</i>?"
(Nay, but Reverend and learned Sir: "nothing so
plain," as you justly observe, "that it may not be
explained away;" (p.&nbsp;359;) yet we cannot consent
to have the sense of plain words thus clouded over at
your mere bidding. It is now <i>our</i> turn to declare that
the Interpreter's "object is to read Scripture <i>like any
other book</i>, with a real interest and not merely a conventional
one." It is now <i>we</i> who "want to be able
to open our eyes, and see things as they truly are."
(p.&nbsp;338.) We simply petition for leave to "<i>interpret
Scripture like any other book, by the same rules of
evidence and the same canons of criticism</i>." (p.&nbsp;375.)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxviii" id="Page_clxviii">[clxviii]</a></span>And if this freedom be but conceded to us, there will
be found to be no imaginable reason why the Interpretation
of the Old Testament in the New,&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Christ</span>
Himself being the Majestic Speaker! our present edification
and everlasting welfare being His gracious
purpose!)&mdash;should not be strictly "regarded as <i>the
meaning of the original text</i>." ... But let us hear the
Professor out:&mdash;)</p>

<p>"Our object," (he says, and with this he dismisses
the problem!)&mdash;"Our object is not to attempt here the
determination of these questions; but to point out that
they must be determined before any real progress can
be made, or any agreement arrived at in the Interpretation
of Scripture." (p.&nbsp;370.) ... They must indeed.
But can it be right in this slovenly, slippery style to
shirk a discussion on the issue of which the whole
question may be said to turn? especially on the part
of one who scruples not to prejudge that issue, and
straightway to apply it, (in a manner fatal to the
Truth,) throughout all his hundred pages. Mr. Jowett's
method is ever to <i>assume</i> what he ought to <i>prove</i>, and
then either to be plaintive, or to sneer. "It is a
<i>heathenish or Rabbinical fancy</i>:"&mdash;"Such complexity
would place the Scriptures <i>below human compositions</i>
in general; for it would deprive them of the ordinary
intelligibleness of human language" (p.&nbsp;382):&mdash;&amp;c.</p>

<p>"Is the Interpretation of the Old Testament in
the New to be regarded as the <i>meaning of the original
text</i>; or an <i>accommodation of it to the thoughts of other
times</i>?" (p.&nbsp;370.) This is Mr. Jowett's question; the
question which it is "<i>not his object</i> to attempt to determine;"
but which I, on the contrary, have made it
<i>my</i> object to discuss in my VIth Sermon,&mdash;p.&nbsp;183 to
p.&nbsp;220. Without troubling the reader however now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxix" id="Page_clxix">[clxix]</a></span>to wade through those many pages, let me at least
explain to him in a few words what Mr. Jowett's
question really amounts to: namely this,&mdash;Do the
Apostles and Evangelists, does our Blessed <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
Himself, when He professes to explain the mysterious
significancy of the Old Testament,&mdash;<i>invariably,&mdash;in
every instance,&mdash;misrepresent "the meaning of the original
text</i>?" And the answer to this question I am
content to await from any candid person of plain unsophisticated
understanding. Is it credible, concerning
the Divine expositions found in St. Matth. xxii.
31, 32,&mdash;xxii. 43-5,&mdash;xii. 39, 40,&mdash;xi. 10,&mdash;St. John
viii. 17,18,&mdash;i. 52,&mdash;vi. 31, &amp;c.,&mdash;x. 34-5:&mdash;the Apostolic
interpretations found in 1 Cor. ix. 9-11,&mdash;x.
1-6,&mdash;xv. 20,&mdash;Heb. ii. 5-9,&mdash;vii. 1-10,&mdash;Gal.
iv. 21-31:&mdash;is it conceivable, I ask, that <i>not one</i> of
all these places should exhibit the actual '<i>meaning of
the original text</i>?' And yet, (as Mr. Jowett himself is
forced to admit,)&mdash;"If we attribute to the details of
the Mosaical ritual a reference to the New Testament,
or suppose the passage of the Red Sea to be regarded
not merely as a figure of Baptism, but as a preordained
type;&mdash;<i>the principle is conceded</i>!" (p.&nbsp;369.)
"A little more or a little less of the method does not
make the difference." (<i>Ibid.</i>) In a word,&mdash;in such
case, Mr. Jowett's Essay falls to the ground!... To
proceed however.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The case of Interpretation has not yet been
fully set before the reader. Hitherto, we have merely
traced the problem back to the fountain-head, and
dealt with it simply as <i>a Scriptural question</i>. We
have shewn what light is thrown upon <i>Interpretation</i>
by the volume of <i>Inspiration</i>. The subject has been
treated in the same way in the Vth and VIth of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxx" id="Page_clxx">[clxx]</a></span>Sermons. But it will not be improper, in this place,&mdash;it
is even indispensable,&mdash;to develope the problem
a little more fully; and to explain that it is of much
larger extent.</p>

<p>Now, there is a family resemblance in the method of
all ancient expositions of Holy Scripture which vindicates
for them, however remotely, a common origin.
There is a resemblance in the general way of handling
the Inspired Word which can only be satisfactorily
explained by supposing that the remote type of all
was the oral teaching of the Apostles themselves.
In truth, is it credible that the early Christians would
have been so forgetful of the discourses of the men
who had seen the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that no trace of it,&mdash;no
tradition of so much as <i>the manner</i> of it,&mdash;should have
lingered on for a hundred years after the death of
the last of the Apostles; down to the time when
Origen, for example, was a young man?... It cannot
possibly be!</p>

<p>(i.) "The things which thou hast heard of me among
many witnesses," (writes the great Apostle to his
son Timothy,) "the same commit thou to faithful
men, who shall be able to teach others also<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>." Provision
is thus made by the aged Saint,&mdash;<i>in the last
of his Epistles</i>,&mdash;for the transmission of his inspired
teaching<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> to a second and a third generation. Now
the words just quoted were written about the year
65, at which time Timothy was a young man. Unless
we suppose that <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span> curtailed the
lives of the chief depositaries of His Word, Timothy
will have lived on till <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 100; so that "faithful
men" who died in the middle of the next century
might have been trained and taught by him for many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxi" id="Page_clxxi">[clxxi]</a></span>years. It follows, that the "faithful men" last
spoken of will have been "able to teach others also,"
whose writings (if they wrote at all) would range
from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 190 to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 210. Now, just such a writer
is Hippolytus,&mdash;who is known to have been taught
by that "faithful man" Iren&aelig;us<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>,&mdash;to whom, as it
happens, the deposit was "committed" by Polycarp,&mdash;who
stood to St. John in the self-same relation as
Timothy to St. Paul!</p>

<p>(ii.) Our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> is repeatedly declared to have interpreted
the Old Testament to His Disciples. For
instance, to the two going to Emmaus, "beginning
at Moses and all the Prophets, <i>He interpreted to them
in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself</i><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>."
Moreover, before He left the world, He solemnly
promised His Apostles that the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, whom
the <span class="smcap">Father</span> should send in His Name, "should <i>teach
them all things</i>, and <i>bring to their remembrance all things
which He had spoken to them</i><a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>." Shall we believe that
the Treasury of <i>Divine Inspiration</i> thus opened by
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself was straightway closed up by its
human guardians, and at once forgotten? Shall we
not rather believe that Cleopas and his companion,
(for instance,) forthwith repeated their <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> words
to every member of the Apostolic body, and to others
also; that they were questioned again and again by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxii" id="Page_clxxii">[clxxii]</a></span>adoring listeners, even to their extremest age; aye,
and that they taxed their memories to the utmost in
order to recal every little word, every particular of
our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> Divine utterance? It must be so!
And the echo, the remote echo of that exposition,
depend upon it! descended to a second, aye and to
a third generation; yea, and has come down, faintly,
and feebly it may be, but yet essentially and truly,
even to ourselves!</p>

<p>(iii.) And yet,&mdash;(for we would not willingly incur
the charge of being fanciful in so solemn and important
a matter,)&mdash;the great fact to be borne in mind,
(and it is the great fact which nothing can ever set
aside or weaken,) is, that for the first century at least
of our &aelig;ra, there existed within the Christian Church
<i>the gift of Prophecy</i>; that is, of <i>Inspired Interpretation</i><a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.
The minds of the Apostles, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself
"opened, <i>to understand the Scriptures</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>." Can it be
any matter of surprise that men so enlightened, when
they had been miraculously endowed with the gift of
tongues<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>, and scattered over the face of the ancient
civilized World, should have disseminated the same
principles of Catholic Interpretation, as well as the
same elements of Saving Truth? When this miraculous
<i>gift</i> ceased, its <i>results</i> did not also come to an
end. The fountain dried up, but the streams which
it had sent forth yet "made glad the City of <span class="smcap">God</span>."
And by what possible logic can the teaching of the
early Church be severed from its source? It cannot be
supposed for an instant that such a severance ever
took place. The teaching of the Apostolic age was
the immediate parent of the teaching of the earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxiii" id="Page_clxxiii">[clxxiii]</a></span>of the Fathers,&mdash;in whose Schools it is matter of
history that those Patristic writers with whom we
are most familiar, studied and became famous. Accordingly,
we discover a method of Interpreting Holy
Scripture strictly resembling that employed by our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and His Apostles, <i>in all the earliest Patristic
writings</i>. As documents increase, the evidence is
multiplied; and at the end of two or three centuries
after the death of St. John the Evangelist, voices are
heard from Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine;
from Antioch and from other parts of Syria; from
the Eastern and the Western extremities of North
Africa; from many regions of Asia Minor; from Constantinople
and from Greece; from Rome, from Milan,
and from other parts of Italy; from Cyprus and from
Gaul;&mdash;all singing in unison; all singing the same
heavenly song!... In what way but one is so extraordinary
a phenomenon to be accounted for? Are
we to believe that there was a general conspiracy of
the East and the West, the North and the South,
to interpret Holy Scripture in a certain way; and
that way, the wrong way?</p>

<p>Enough has been said, it is thought, to shew that
many of Mr. Jowett's remarks about the value of Patristic
evidence are either futile or incorrect; or that they
betray an entire misapprehension of the whole question,
not to say a thorough want of appreciation of the
claims of Antiquity. We do not yield to the 'Essayist
and Reviewer' in veneration for the Inspired page;
and trust that enough has been said to shew it. Our
eye, when we read Scripture, (like his,) "is fixed on
the form of One like the Son of Man; or of the Prophet
who was girded with a garment of camel's hair; or of
the Apostle who had a thorn in the flesh." (p.&nbsp;338.)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxiv" id="Page_clxxiv">[clxxiv]</a></span>We are only unlike Mr. Jowett we fear in <i>this</i>,&mdash;that
<i>we</i> believe <i>ex animo</i> that the first-named was the
Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span>, "equal to the <span class="smcap">Father</span>," and "of one
substance with the <span class="smcap">Father</span><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>:" and further that St.
Paul's fourteen Epistles are all <i>inspired writings</i>, in an
entirely different sense from the Dialogues of Plato or
the Tragedies of Sophocles. It follows, that however
riveted our mental gaze may be on the awful forms
which come before us in Holy Scripture,&mdash;as often as
we con <i>the inspired record of the actions and of the sayings
of those men</i>, we are constrained many a time to
look upward, and to exclaim with the Psalmist, "Thy
thoughts are very deep<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>!" And often if asked,
"Understandest thou what thou readest?"&mdash;we must
still answer with the Ethiopian, "How can I, except
some man should guide me<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>?"</p>

<p>(iv.) To assume however that our defective knowledge
"cannot be supplied by the <i>conjectures</i> of Fathers
or Divines," (p.&nbsp;338,) is in some sort to beg the
question at issue. To say of the student of Scripture
that "the history of Christendom, and all the afterthoughts
of Theology, <i>are nothing to him</i>:" (p.&nbsp;338:)
that "he has to imagine himself a disciple of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
or Paul, and <i>to disengage himself from all that follows</i>:"
(<i>Ibid.</i>:) is not the language of modesty, but of
inordinate conceit. In Mr. Jowett it is in fact something
infinitely worse; for he shews that his object
thereby is to "obtain an unembarrassed opportunity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxv" id="Page_clxxv">[clxxv]</a></span>of applying all the resources of a so-called criticism to
discredit and destroy the written record itself<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>."</p>

<p>"True indeed it is, that more than any other subject
of human knowledge, Biblical criticism has hung (<i>sic.</i>)
to the past;" (p.&nbsp;340;) but the reason is also obvious.
It is because, in the words of great Bishop Pearson,
"Philosophia quotidie <i>progressu</i>, Theologia nisi <i>regressu</i>
non crescit<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>." "O ye who are devoting yourselves
to the Divine Science of Theology," (he exclaims,)
"and whose cheeks grow pale over the study
of Holy Scripture above all; ye who either fill the
venerable office of the Priesthood or intend it, and are
hereafter to undertake the awful cure of souls:&mdash;rid
yourselves of that itch of the present age, the love of
novelty. Make it your business to inquire for that
which was from the beginning. Resort for counsel to
the fountain-head. Have recourse to Antiquity. Return
to the holy Fathers. Look back to the primitive
Church. In the words of the Prophet,&mdash;'<i>Ask for the
old paths</i><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.'"</p>

<p>When therefore Mr. Jowett classes together "the
early Fathers, the Roman Catholic mystical writers,
the Swiss and German Reformers, and the Nonconformist
Divines," (p.&nbsp;377,)&mdash;he either shews a most
lamentable want of intellectual perspective, or a most
perverse understanding. So jumbled into one confused
heap, it may not be altogether untrue to say of
Commentators generally, that "the words of Scripture
suggest to them <i>their own thoughts or feelings</i>." (p.&nbsp;377.)
But when it is straightway added, "There is nothing
in such a view derogatory to <i>the Saints and Doctors of
former ages</i>," (<i>Ibid.</i>,) we are constrained, (for the reasons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxvi" id="Page_clxxvi">[clxxvi]</a></span>already before the reader,) to remonstrate against so
misleading and deceitful a way of putting the case.
Mr. Jowett desires to be understood not to depreciate
"the genius or learning of famous men of old," when
he remarks "that <i>Aquinas or Bernard did not shake
themselves free from the mystical method of the Patristic
times</i>." (<i>Ibid.</i>) But with singular obtuseness, or with
pitiful disingenuousness, he does his best by such
words to shut out from view the real question at issue,&mdash;namely,
<i>the exegetical value of Patristic Antiquity</i>.
For the Church of England, when she appeals, (as
she repeatedly does,) to "the Ancient Fathers," does
not by any means intend such names as the Abbot
of Clairvaux, who flourished in the middle of the
twelfth century; or Thomas of Aquinum, who lived
later into the thirteenth. It is the spirit of <i>the ante-Nicene
age</i> which she defers to; the Fathers of <i>the
first four or five centuries</i> to whose opinion she gives
reverent attention; as her formularies abundantly
shew. Whether therefore Aquinas and Bernard were
or were not able to "shake themselves free from the
mystical method <i>of the Patristic times</i>," matters very
little. The point to be observed is that <i>the Writers of
the Patristic times</i>, as a matter of fact, "did not shake
themselves <i>free from the mystical method of" <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and
His Apostles</i>!</p>

<p>Very far am I from denying that "any one who,
instead of burying himself in the pages of the commentators,
would learn the Sacred Writings by heart,
and paraphrase them in English, will probably make
a nearer approach to their true meaning than he
would gather from any Commentary." Quite certain
is it that "the true use of Interpretation is to get rid
of interpretation, and leave us alone in company with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxvii" id="Page_clxxvii">[clxxvii]</a></span>the author." (p.&nbsp;384.) But this is quite a distinct
and different matter, as every person of unsophisticated
understanding must perceive at once. The same thing
will be found stated by myself, in a subsequent part
of the present volume, at considerable length<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>; the
qualifying condition having been introduced at p.&nbsp;16.
The truth is, a man can no more divest himself of the
conditions of thought habitual to one familiar with his
Prayer-Book, than he can withdraw himself from the
atmosphere of light in which he moves. <i>Not</i> the abuse
of Commentators on Holy Scripture, but <i>the principle
on which Holy Scripture itself is to be interpreted</i>,&mdash;is
the real question at issue: the fundamental question
which underlies this, being of course the vital one,&mdash;namely,
<i>Is the Bible an inspired book, or not</i>?</p>

<p>Apart from what has been already urged concerning
"the torrent of <i>Patristic</i> Interpretation<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>" which flows
down not so much from the fountain-head of Scripture,
(wherein so many specimens of <i>Inspired</i> Interpretation
are preserved,) as from the fontal source of all Wisdom
and Knowledge,&mdash;even the lips of the Incarnate <span class="smcap">Word</span>
Himself;&mdash;apart from this, a very important Historical
circumstance calls for notice in this place.</p>

<p>How did Christianity originate? how did it first
establish a footing in the world? "The answer is, By
the preaching of living men, who said they were commissioned
by <span class="smcap">God</span> to proclaim it. <i>That</i> was the origin
and first establishment of Christianity. There is indeed
a vague and unreasoning notion prevalent that
Christianity was <i>taken from the New Testament</i>. The
notion is historically untrue. Christianity was widely
extended through the civilized world before the New
Testament was written; and its several books were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxviii" id="Page_clxxviii">[clxxviii]</a></span>successively addressed to various bodies of Christian
believers; to bodies, that is, who already possessed the
faith of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in its integrity. When, indeed, <span class="smcap">God</span>
ceased to inspire persons to write these books, and
when they were all collected together into what we
call the New Testament, the existing Faith of the
Church, derived from oral teaching, was tested by
comparison with this Inspired Record. And it henceforth
became the standing law of the Church that
nothing should be received as necessary to Salvation,
which could not stand that test. But still, though
thus tested, (every article being proved by the New
Testament,) Christianity is not taken from it; <i>for it
existed before it</i>.</p>

<p>"What, then, was the Christianity which was thus
established? Have we any record of it as it existed
before the New Testament became the sole authoritative
standard? I answer, we have. The Creeds
of the Christian Church are the record of it. That is
precisely what they purport to be: not documents
taken from the New Testament, but documents transmitting
to us the Faith as it was held from the beginning;
the Faith as it was preached by inspired men,
before the inspired men put forth any writings; the
Faith once for all delivered to the Saints. Accordingly
you will find that our Church in her viiith Article does
not ground her affirmation that the Creeds ought to
be 'thoroughly received and believed,' on the fact
that they <i>were taken</i> from the New Testament, (which
they were <i>not</i>;) but on the fact that '<i>they may be
proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture</i>.'"</p>

<p>It follows therefore from what has been said, that
even if bad men could succeed in destroying the authority
of the Bible as the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, all could not be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxix" id="Page_clxxix">[clxxix]</a></span>up with Christianity. There would <i>still</i> remain to be
dealt with the Faith as it exists in the world; the
Faith held from the beginning; the Faith once delivered
to the Saints. None of the assaults on Holy
Scripture can touch <i>that</i>; for it traces itself to an
independent origin. The evil work, therefore, would
have to be begun all over again. The special doctrines
which are impugned in 'Essays and Reviews'
do not stand or fall with the Inspiration or Interpretation
of Scripture; but are stereotyped in the Faith
of Christendom. "The Fall of Man, Original Sin, the
Atonement, the Divinity of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the Trinity, all
have their place in the Faith held from the beginning.
They are imbedded in the Creeds, and in that general
scheme of Doctrine which circles round the Creeds,
and is involved in them. Nay, curiously enough,&mdash;or
rather I should say providentially,&mdash;the very point
against which the attacks of this book are principally
directed, namely the Inspiration of the Old Testament,
is in express terms asserted there:&mdash;<i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>
'<i>spake by the Prophets</i><a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.'"</p>

<p>It remains to shew the bearing of these remarks
on Mr. Jowett's Essay.&mdash;With infinite perseverance,
he dwells upon "the nude Scripture, the merest letter
of the Sacred Volume, as if in it and in it alone,
resided the entire Revelation of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and all possible
means of judging what that Revelation consists
of: whereas this is very far indeed from being the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxx" id="Page_clxxx">[clxxx]</a></span>case. Every single Book of the New Testament was
written, as we have seen, to persons <i>already in possession
of Christian Truth</i>. It is quite erroneous therefore,
historically and notoriously erroneous, to suppose
either that the Divine Institution of the Church, or
that its Doctrines, were literally founded upon the
written words of Holy Scripture; or that they can
impart no illustration nor help in the Interpretation
of those written words.... The complete possession
of the saving Truth belonged to the Christian Church
not by degrees, nor in lapse of time, but from the
first. Of that saving truth, thus taught and thus
possessed, <i>the Apostles' Creed</i>, growing up as it did
on every side of Christendom as the faithful record
of the uniform oral teaching of the Apostles, is the
true and precious historical monument<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>; and I venture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxi" id="Page_clxxxi">[clxxxi]</a></span>to say that if any person claims to reject the
Apostles' Creed as an auxiliary, a great and invaluable
auxiliary, in interpreting the writings of the
Apostles, he shews himself to be very wanting indeed
in appreciation of the comparative value of Historical
Evidence, and of the true principles of Historical
Philosophy.&mdash;And not the Apostles' Creed only; but
the whole history and tradition of the universal
Church,&mdash;needing, no doubt, skill and discretion in
its application,&mdash;supply, when applied with requisite
skill and discretion, very valuable and real aid in
interpreting Holy Scripture<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>."</p>

<p>When therefore Mr. Jowett speaks contemptuously
of "the attempt to adapt the truths of Scripture to
the doctrines of the Creeds," (p.&nbsp;353,) the kindest
thing which can be said is that he writes like an ignorant,
or at least an unlearned man. "The Creeds"
(he says) "are acknowledged to be a part of Christianity....
Yet it does not follow that they should
be pressed into the service of the Interpreter." Why
not? we ask. "The <i>growth of ideas</i>," (he replies,)
"in the interval which separated the first century
from the fourth or sixth makes it <i>impossible</i> to apply
the language of the one to the explanation of the
other. Between Scripture and the Nicene or Athanasian
Creeds, <i>a world of the understanding comes in</i>;
and mankind are no longer at the same point as when
the whole of Christianity was contained in the words
'Believe on the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span> and thou mayest
be saved;' when the Gospel centred in the attachment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxii" id="Page_clxxxii">[clxxxii]</a></span>to a living and recently departed friend and
Lord." (p.&nbsp;353.)</p>

<p>But there is a fallacy or a falsity at every step
of this argument. For <i>when</i> did the Gospel ever
"centre in attachment?" or <i>when</i> was "the whole of
Christianity contained" in one short sentence? Supposing
too that "a world of the understanding" <i>does</i>
come in between the first century and the sixth;
how does it follow that it is "impossible" to apply
the language of the Creeds to the interpretation of
Holy Scripture? Explain to me how that "world of
understanding" affects <i>the Nicene</i> Creed? Even in the
case of that most precious Creed called the Athanasian,&mdash;why
need we <i>assume</i> that "the growth of ideas"
has been a spurious growth? What if it should prove,
on the contrary, that the development has been that
of the plant from the seed<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>? Above all, why talk of
"the fourth <i>or sixth</i> century,"&mdash;as if the Creeds were
not essentially much older; nay, <i>co-eval with Christianity
itself</i>?... Such writing shews nothing so
much as a confused mind,&mdash;a weak, ill-informed, and
illogical thinker.</p>

<p>Indeed Mr. Jowett seems to be altogether in the
dark on the subject of the Creeds: for he speaks of
them as "the result of three or four centuries of
reflection and controversy," (p.&nbsp;353,)&mdash;which is by no
means true of all of them; nor, except in a certain
sense, of any. But when he inquires,&mdash;"If the occurrence
of the phraseology of the Nicene age in
a verse of the Epistles would detect the spuriousness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxiii" id="Page_clxxxiii">[clxxxiii]</a></span>of the verse in which it was found,&mdash;how can the
Nicene <i>or Athanasian Creed</i> be a suitable instrument
for the interpretation of Scripture?" (p.&nbsp;354.)&mdash;he
simply asks a fool's question. The cases are not only
not parallel, but there is not even any analogy between
them. Let us hear him a little further:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Absorbed as St. Paul was in the person of Christ,
... he does not speak of Him as 'equal to the
Father,' or 'of one substance with the Father<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>.'
Much of the language of the Epistles, (passages for
example such as Romans i. 2: Philippians ii. 6,)
would lose their meaning if distributed in alternate
clauses between our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Humanity and Divinity<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.
Still greater difficulties would be introduced into the
Gospels by the attempt to identify them with the
Creeds<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. We should have to suppose that He was
and was not tempted<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>; that when He prayed to His
Father He prayed also to Himself<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; that He knew
and did not know 'of that hour' of which He as well
as the angels were ignorant<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. How could He have
said 'My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxiv" id="Page_clxxxiv">[clxxxiv]</a></span>Me?' or 'Father, if it be possible let this cup pass
from Me.' How could He have doubted whether
'when the Son of Man cometh He shall find faith
upon the earth<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>?' These simple and touching words,"
(p.&nbsp;355,)&mdash;pah!</p>

<p>Now if what precedes means anything at all,&mdash;(I
am by no means certain however that it does!)&mdash;it
means that the writer does not believe in the Divinity
of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>. Unless the sentence which
is without a reference to the foot of the page be not
a denial of the fundamental Doctrine of the Faith<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>,&mdash;I
do not understand it. But look at <i>all</i> which precedes;
and then say if those are the remarks of a man entitled
to dogmatize "On the Interpretation of Scripture." ...
If Mr. Jowett really means that the Creeds
<i>cannot be reconciled with the Bible</i>,&mdash;how can he himself
subscribe to the VIIIth Article? If he means
nothing of the kind,&mdash;why does he write in such
a weak, cloudy, illogical way?</p>

<p>But the whole of the case has not even yet been
stated. Down from the remote period of which we
have been hitherto speaking,&mdash;the age of primitive
Creeds, and [oe]cumenical Councils, and ancient Fathers,&mdash;in
every country of the civilized world to which
the Gospel has spread,&mdash;the loftiest Intellect, the profoundest
Learning, the sincerest Piety, have invariably
endorsed the ancient and original method of interpretation.
I am not implying that such corroboration
was in any sense <i>required</i>; but the circumstance
that it has been <i>obtained</i>, at least deserves attention.
Modes of thought are dependent on times and countries.
There is a fashion in all things. Great advances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxv" id="Page_clxxxv">[clxxxv]</a></span>in Science,&mdash;grand epochs in civilization,&mdash;vicissitudes
of opinion,&mdash;difference of institutions, national
traditions, and the like,&mdash;might be supposed to
have wrought a permanent change even in this department
of Sacred Science. But it is not so. The
storm has raged from one quarter or other of the heavens,
but has ever spent its violence in vain. Still
has the Church Catholic retained her own unbroken
tradition. To keep to the history of that Church to
which we, by <span class="smcap">God's</span> mercy, belong:&mdash;The constant appeal,
at the time of our own great Reformation, was
to the Fathers of the first four centuries. Ever since,
the temper and spirit of our Commentators has been
to revert to the same standard, to reproduce the
same teaching. The most powerful minds and the
most holy spirits,&mdash;English Divines of the deepest
thought and largest reading,&mdash;let me add, of the
soundest judgment and severest discrimination,&mdash;have,
in every age, down to the present, gratefully accepted
not only the method, but even the very details of
primitive Patristic Interpretation. But "the acceptance
of a hundred generations and the growing authority
arising from it,"&mdash;like "the institutions based
upon such ancient writings, and the history into which
they have entwined themselves indissolubly for many
centuries,"&mdash;all conspire to "constitute a perpetually
increasing and strengthening<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>" body of evidence on
the subject of Sacred Interpretation.</p>

<p>Now, to oppose to the learning, and piety, and
wisdom, of every age of the English Church,&mdash;to
the unbroken testimony of the Church Universal,&mdash;(3)&nbsp;to
the torrent of Patristic Antiquity,&mdash;(4)&nbsp;the
decision of early Councils, and (5)&nbsp;the 'still small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxvi" id="Page_clxxxvi">[clxxxvi]</a></span>voice' of primitive Creeds,&mdash;yet more, (6)&nbsp;to the constant
practice of the Apostles,&mdash;and, above all, (7)&nbsp;to
the indisputable method of our Divine <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself;&mdash;to
oppose to all this mighty accumulation of evidence,
the simple <i>&agrave; priori</i> convictions of&mdash;Mr. Jowett!
savours so strongly of the ridiculous, that it really
seems superfluous to linger over the antithesis for
a single moment.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Our task might now be looked upon as completed.&mdash;It
only remains, in justice to the gentleman
whose method we have been considering, to ascertain
by what considerations he is induced to reject that
method of Interpretation which, as we have seen, enjoys
such overwhelming sanction.</p>

<p>(i) In opposition to what goes before, then, he
throws out a suggestion, that "nothing would be
more likely to restore a natural feeling on this subject
than a History of the Interpretation of Scripture.
It would take us back to the beginning; it would
present in one view the causes which have darkened
the meaning of words in the course of ages." (p.&nbsp;338-9.)
"Such a work would enable us to separate the elements
of Doctrine and Tradition with which the
meaning of Scripture is encumbered in our own day."
(p.&nbsp;339.)</p>

<p>Let us here be well understood with our author.
The advantage of a good "History of Interpretation"
would indeed be incalculably great. But Mr. Jowett,
(like most other writers of his class,) <i>assumes</i> the point
he has to <i>prove</i>, when he insinuates that the result of
such a contribution to our Theological Literature would
be to shew that all the world has been in error for
1700 years, and that he alone is right. That 'erring
fancy' has <i>often</i> been at work in the fields of sacred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxvii" id="Page_clxxxvii">[clxxxvii]</a></span>criticism,&mdash;<i>who</i> ever doubted? That there have been
epochs of Interpretation,&mdash;different Schools,&mdash;and
varying tastes, in the long course of so many centuries
of mingled light and darkness, learning and
barbarism;&mdash;what need to declare? A faithful history
of Interpretation would of course establish these facts
on a sure foundation.</p>

<p>But the Reverend Author forgets his Logic when
he goes on from these undoubted generalities to imply
that all has been confusion and utter uncertainty until
now. Above all, common regard for the facts of the
case ought to have preserved him from putting forth
so monstrous a falsehood as the following:&mdash;"<i>Among
German Commentators</i> there is for the first time in the
history of the world, an approach to agreement and
certainty." (p.&nbsp;340.)</p>

<p>Let us however,&mdash;passing by the many crooked
remarks and unsound inferences with which the Reverend
writer, (<i>more suo</i>,) delights to perplex a plain
question<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>,&mdash;invite him to abide by the test which he
himself proposes. For 1700 years, (he says,) the
Interpretation of Scripture has been obscured and
encumbered by successive Schools of Interpretation.
The Interpreter's concern (he says) is <i>with the Bible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxviii" id="Page_clxxxviii">[clxxxviii]</a></span>itself</i>. "The simple words of that book he tries to
preserve absolutely pure from the refinements of later
times.... The greater part of his learning is a knowledge
of the text itself." [He is evidently the very
man who <i>sweeps the house to discover the pearl of great
price</i>. (p.&nbsp;414.)] "He has no delight in the voluminous
literature which has overgrown it. He has
no theory of Interpretation. A few rules guarding
against common errors are enough for him.... He
wants to be able to open his eyes, and see or imagine
things as they truly are." (p.&nbsp;338.) [How
crooked by the way is all this! "He has no <i>theory</i>
of Interpretation<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>?" Why, no; for the best of all reasons.
He <i>denies Inspiration altogether!</i> His "theory"
is that <i>the Bible is an uninspired Book!</i> ... How
peculiar too, and how plaintive is the "want" of the
supposed Interpreter, "<i>to he able to open his eyes</i>;"&mdash;glued
up, as they no doubt are, by the superstitious
tendencies of the nineteenth century, and the tyranny
of an intolerant age!]</p>

<p>But we may perhaps state the matter more intelligibly
and simply, thus:&mdash;In order to ascertain the
<i>true</i> principle of Scriptural Interpretation, let us,&mdash;divesting
ourselves of the complicated and voluminous
lore of 1700 years,&mdash;<i>resort to the Bible itself</i>. Let us
go for our views to the fountain-head; and abide by
what we shall discover <i>there</i>.</p>

<p>A fairer proposal (as I think) never was made. It
exactly describes the method which I have humbly
endeavoured myself to pursue in the ensuing Sermons.
The inquiry will be found elaborated from <a href="#Page_141">p.&nbsp;141</a> to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_clxxxix" id="Page_clxxxix">[clxxxix]</a></span>p.&nbsp;160 of the present volume; and the result is to be
read on the last-named page, in the following words:&mdash;"that
it may be regarded as a fundamental rule,
that the Bible <i>is not to be interpreted like a common
book</i>. This I gather infallibly from the plain fact,
that <i>the inspired writers themselves</i> habitually interpret
it <i>as no other book either is, or can be interpreted</i>.&mdash;Next,
I assert without fear of contradiction that inspired
Interpretation, whatever varieties of method it may
exhibit, is yet uniform and unequivocal in this one
result; namely, that it proves Holy Scripture to be
of far deeper significancy than at first sight appears.
By no imaginable artifice of Rhetoric or sophistry of
evasion,&mdash;by no possible vehemence of denial or plausibility
of counter assertion,&mdash;can it be rendered probable
that Scripture has invariably one only meaning;
and <i>that</i> meaning, the most obvious and easy."</p>

<p>Now, the reader is requested to observe that what
precedes is <i>the direct contradictory</i> of the position which
Mr. Jowett has written his Essay in order to establish.
And thus we keep for ever coming back to his &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;
&#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;,&mdash;the fundamental falsity which underlies the
whole of what he has written.</p>

<p>(ii) But although we have eagerly resorted to Scripture
itself in order to ascertain <i>on what principle</i> Scripture
ought to be interpreted, we cannot for a moment
allow some of the sophistries with which the Reverend
Author has encumbered the question, to escape without
castigation. He may not first court an appeal to
the School of Apostolical Interpretation; and then,
before the result of that appeal has been ascertained,
go off in praise of the illumination of the present age;
and claim to represent the Theological mind of Europe
in his own person. "Educated persons," (he has the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxc" id="Page_cxc">[cxc]</a></span>impertinence to assert,) "are <i>beginning to ask</i>&nbsp;(!), not
what Scripture may be <i>made</i> to mean, but what it
<i>does</i>. And it is no exaggeration to say that he who
in the present state of knowledge will confine himself
to <i>the plain meaning of words</i>, and the study of
their context, may know more of the original spirit
and intention of the authors of the New Testament
<i>than all the controversial writers of former ages put
together</i>." (pp.&nbsp;340-1.) This might be tolerated perhaps,
in the self-constituted oracle of a Mechanics'
Institute; but as proceeding from a Divinity Lecturer
in one of the first Colleges in Oxford, I hesitate
not to declare that such an opinion is simply disgraceful.</p>

<p>Very much of a piece with this, in point of flippancy,&mdash;(though
barely consistent with his frequent
assertions that the entire subject is hemmed in by
grave difficulties,)&mdash;are the Regius Professor of Greek's
remarks on the value of learning as a help to the Interpretation
of Holy Writ. "<i>Learning obscures</i> as well as
illustrates." (p.&nbsp;337.)&mdash;"There seem to be reasons for
doubting whether any <i>considerable light</i> can be thrown
on the New Testament from inquiry into <i>the language</i>."
(p.&nbsp;393.)&mdash;"Minute corrections of tenses or particles
are <i>no good</i>." (p.&nbsp;393.)&mdash;"Discussions respecting the
chronology of St. Paul's life and his second imprisonment;
or about the identity of James, the brother of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; or, in another department, <i>respecting the
use of the Greek article,&mdash;have gone far beyond the line
of utility</i>." (p.&nbsp;393.) "The minuteness of the study
of Greek in our own day has also a tendency <i>to introduce
into the text associations</i> which are not really found
there." (p.&nbsp;391.)&mdash;Lastly, he complains of "the error
of interpreting every particle, as though it were a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxci" id="Page_cxci">[cxci]</a></span>link in the argument; instead of being, as is often
the case, <i>an excrescence of style</i>." (p.&nbsp;391.)</p>

<p>So then, in brief, the Fathers are in a conspiracy to
mislead: Creeds and Councils encumber the sense:
Modern Commentators are not to be trusted: the comparison
of Scripture with Scripture, except it be "of
the same age and the same authors," "will tend rather
to confuse than to elucidate:" (p.&nbsp;383:) "Learning obscures,"
and an accurate appreciation of the meaning of
the text is "no good!"&mdash;"When the <i>meaning of Greek
words</i> is once known<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>, the young student has almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxcii" id="Page_cxcii">[cxcii]</a></span><i>all the real materials which are possessed by the greatest
Biblical scholar</i>, in the book itself." (p.&nbsp;384.) In
a word, (as Dr. Moberly has had the manliness to
remark,)&mdash;"It simply comes to this: A little Greek,
(not too much,) and a strong self-relying imagination,
and you may interpret Holy Scripture as well as&mdash;Mr.
Jowett!" (p. lxii.) ... Benighted himself, the unhappy
author of this Essay is so apprehensive lest
a ray of light from Heaven shall break in upon one of
his disciples,&mdash;even sideways, as it were, from the
margin of the Bible,&mdash;that he carefully prohibits "the
indiscriminate use of parallel passages" as "useless
and uncritical." ... Yet may one not <i>with discrimination</i>
refer to the margin?&mdash;Better not! "No good!" (p.
393.) replies the Oracle. "Even the critical use of
parallel passages is <i>not without danger</i>." (p.&nbsp;383.) ...
O shame! And all this from a College Tutor and
Lecturer on Divinity! <i>this</i> from one entrusted with
the care of educating young men! <i>this</i> from a Regius
Professor of Greek<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxciii" id="Page_cxciii">[cxciii]</a></span>
Mr. Jowett congratulates himself that "Biblical
criticism has made two great steps onward,&mdash;at the
time of the Reformation, and <i>in our own day</i>." But
his notion is amply refuted by the known facts of the
case: for when he adds,&mdash;"The diffusion of a critical
spirit in History and Literature is affecting the criticism
of the Bible in our own day in a manner not unlike
the burst of intellectual life in the fifteenth or
sixteenth centuries;" (p.&nbsp;340;) he clearly requires to
be reminded that the success of the Divinity of the
Reformation was owing to the grand appeal then
made to <i>the Patristic writings</i>.</p>

<p>So far then as any of ourselves are resorting to <i>those</i>
sources of information, there may be a faint resemblance
<i>in kind</i> between the spirit which animates us,
and that which wrought so nobly in the Fathers of
our spiritual freedom,&mdash;Cranmer and Ridley and the
other learned and holy men who revised our Offices.
But if "<i>German</i> Commentators" and <i>their</i> method be
supposed to be the ideals to which the age is tending,
<i>then</i> the Theology of the middle of the nineteenth
century stands in marked <i>contrast</i> to what prevailed
in the middle of the sixteenth; and our spirit is <i>the
very reverse of theirs</i>.&mdash;But I hasten on.</p>

<p>(iii) "The uncertainty which prevails in the Interpretation
of Scripture," Mr. Jowett proposes to get
rid of,&mdash;(this is in fact the aim of his entire Essay,)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxciv" id="Page_cxciv">[cxciv]</a></span> by
denying that there are in Scripture any deeper
meanings to interpret. In the meantime, by every
device in his power, he seeks from <i>&agrave; priori</i> considerations,
(as we have seen,) to shew that no such meanings
can exist. We allow ourselves to be biassed,
to a singular extent, he says, "by certain previous
suppositions with which we come to the perusal of
Scripture." (p.&nbsp;342.) <i>But</i> for this, "no one would
interpret Scripture as many do." (<i>Ibid.</i>) Let us ascertain
then what these erroneous "suppositions" are.</p>

<p>(&#945;) "The failure of a prophecy is never admitted,
in spite of Scripture and of history, (Jer. xxxvi. 30.
Isaiah xxiii. Amos vii. 10-17.)" (p.&nbsp;343.)</p>

<p>Now this can only mean two things: viz. first,
that a Divine Prophecy is <i>not</i> an infallible utterance:
and secondly, that the three places quoted from the
Old Testament are <i>proofs</i> of the fallibility of Prophecy;
proofs which ought to overcome prejudice,
and persuade men to renounce their "previous supposition"
that Prophecy is <i>in</i>fallible.</p>

<p>Certainly the charge is a grave one. For if <i>Prophecy</i>
is untrue, then what becomes of Inspiration?</p>

<p>And yet, how stands the case? The writer seems
to have expected "that no one would refer to the passages
that he has bracketed, or that all would be too
ignorant to know the utter groundlessness of his assumption.
If there are, in the whole Scripture, two
past prophecies which were signally and remarkably
fulfilled, they are the first two which he has selected
as instances to be dropped down, without a remark,
of the failure of Scripture prophecies! And as to the
third passage, surely it implies an 'incuria' which
might be deemed 'crassa' to have asserted that it
contained an instance of the non-fulfilment of Pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxcv" id="Page_cxcv">[cxcv]</a></span>phecy:
for it implies that Mr. Jowett has read the
verses to which he refers with so little attention as
not to have discovered that the prediction which
failed of its fulfilment was <i>no utterance of Amos</i>, but
was <i>the message of Amaziah, the priest of Bethel</i>, in
which he falsely attributes to Amos <i>words he had not
spoken</i>!... Surely such slips as these are as discreditable
to a scholar as a Divine<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>!"</p>

<p>And this, from a gentleman who has the impertinence
to remind us oracularly, that "he who would
understand the nature of Prophecy in the Old Testament,
should have <i>the courage to examine how far its
details were minutely fulfilled</i>!" (p.&nbsp;347.) Are we then
to infer that Mr. Jowett's courage failed him when he
came to Amos vii. 10-17?</p>

<p>(&#946;) "The mention of a name later than the supposed
age of the prophet is not allowed, as in other
writings, to be taken in evidence of the date. (Isaiah
xlv. 1.)" (p.&nbsp;343.)</p>

<p>But what is the meaning of this complaint when
applied to Isaiah's well known prophecy concerning
Cyrus? In the words of the excellent critic last
quoted,&mdash;"We know not that we could point to such
an instance as this in the writings of any other author
of credit. Of course, Mr. Jowett knows as well as
we do the distinction between History and Prophecy;
and that the mention in any document of the name
of one who was unborn at the time fixed as the date
of the writing, would be at once a complete <i>disproof</i>
of its accuracy as a history of the past, and a <i>proof</i>
of its accuracy as a prediction of the future. Of
course he also remembers that the point he has <i>to
prove</i> is that this passage is History and not Prediction;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxcvi" id="Page_cxcvi">[cxcvi]</a></span>and his mode of proving is this; <i>he assumes
that it is a history of the past</i>,&mdash;advancing as a charge
against the believers of Revelation, that they do not,
(as they would in any other History,) reject the
genuineness of the passage because it embalms a
future name in a past history!... This audacious,
(for we cannot use a weaker word,) <i>assumption</i> of
what he has <i>to prove</i>, pervades his Essay<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>."</p>

<p>And thus, into whatever department of speculation
we follow this writer, the tortuous path is still found
to conduct us back to the same underlying fallacious
<i>assumption</i>,&mdash;viz. that <i>the Bible is like any other Book</i>;
in other words, is <i>not inspired</i>.</p>

<p>(&#947;) Persons in Mr. Jowett's position, "find themselves
met by a <i>sort of presupposition that '<span class="smcap">God</span> speaks
not as Man speaks</i>.'"&mdash;(p.&nbsp;343.)</p>

<p>"A sort of presupposition," indeed!... Does the
Reverend gentleman really expect that we will stoop
so low as argue <i>this</i> point also with him? It shall
suffice to have branded him with his own words.</p>

<p>"The suspicion of Deism, or perhaps of Atheism,
awaits inquiry. By such fears, a good man&nbsp;(!) refuses
to be influenced: a philosophical mind&nbsp;(!) is apt to cast
them aside with too much bitterness. It is better to
close the book, than to read it under conditions of
thought which are imposed from without." (p.&nbsp;343.)</p>

<p>Well surely, the proximity to Balliol College of the
scene of Cranmer and Ridley's martyrdom, must have
turned the brain of the Regius Professor of Greek!&mdash;Let
him be well assured however that not rational
"Inquiry," but irrational <i>assumption</i>; not the modest
cogitations of "a philosophical mind," but the <i>arrogant
dreams of a weak and confused intellect</i>, are what have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxcvii" id="Page_cxcvii">[cxcvii]</a></span>excited such general indignation of late, among "good
men," from one end of the Kingdom to the other.
Nor could anything probably of equal pretensions be
readily appealed to, which is nevertheless more truly
unphilosophical, fallacious, and foolish, than the Essay
now under consideration.</p>

<p>(iv) Subsequently, (p.&nbsp;344,) Mr. Jowett professes
to grapple with the phenomenon of Inspiration. His
method is instructive. He begins by inadvertently
advancing a direct untruth: for he asserts that for
none "of the higher or supernatural views of Inspiration
is there <i>any foundation</i> in the Gospels or Epistles."
(p.&nbsp;345.)&mdash;Had he then forgotten St. Paul's
statements in Gal. i. 1, 11-17: ii. 2, 7-9. 1 Cor.
xv. 3. Ephes. iii. 3, &amp;c., &amp;c.? But I have established
the contradictory of the Professor's position in
the ensuing Sermons, p.&nbsp;53 to p.&nbsp;57, to which the
reader must be referred.&mdash;This done, he proceeds to
assert that,</p>

<p>(&#945;) Inspiration does not preserve a writer from
inaccuracy. And the charge is substantiated by the
following ridiculous enumeration:&mdash;"One [Evangelist]
supposes the original dwelling-place of our
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Parents to have been Bethlehem<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>, another
Nazareth<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>." (This from a Lecturer on Divinity!
Does Mr. Jowett then suppose that his readers have
never opened the Gospels, and do not know better?
Why, <i>both</i> his statements are simply <i>false!</i>)&mdash;"They
trace His genealogy in different ways." (Yes. In
two. And why not <i>in twenty?</i> Is Mr. Jowett not
aware that a genealogy may be differently traced
through different ancestors?)&mdash;"One mentions the
thieves blaspheming: another has preserved to after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxcviii" id="Page_cxcviii">[cxcviii]</a></span>ages the record of the penitent thief:" (And why
should he not?)&mdash;"They appear to differ about the
day and hour of the Crucifixion." (Yes, <i>they appear</i>
to differ: but <i>they do not differ</i>!)&mdash;"The narrative
of the woman who anointed our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> feet with
ointment is told in all four, each narrative having
more or less considerable variations." (There is no
conceivable reason why this should <i>not</i> have been
as Mr. Jowett relates; but, as a matter of fact, we
have here another of this Gentleman's private <i>blunders</i>,&mdash;shewing
what an uncritical reader he must be, of
that book concerning which he presumes to dogmatize
so freely.)&mdash;"These are a few instances of the differences
which arose in the traditions of the earliest ages
respecting the history of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>." (Nay, but this
is to beg the whole question!)&mdash;"He who wishes
to investigate the character of the sacred writings
<i>should not be afraid</i> to make a catalogue of them all,
with the view of estimating their cumulative weight."
(p.&nbsp;346.) (Truly, it would be well for Mr. Jowett if
he had as little to fear from such "investigations" as
the Evangelists!)</p>

<p>"In the same way, he who would understand the
nature of Prophecy in the Old Testament, should have
the courage to examine how far its details were minutely
fulfilled. <i>The absence of such a fulfilment</i> may
further lead him to discover that he took the letter for
the spirit in expecting it." (p.&nbsp;347.) But really this
is again simply to beg the whole question. Unbecoming
in any writer, how absurd also is such a sentence
from the pen of one who, (as we have lately
seen,) no sooner descends to particulars than he makes
himself ridiculous by betraying his own excessive
ignorance.... "The letter for the spirit," also! which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxcix" id="Page_cxcix">[cxcix]</a></span>is one of the 'cant' expressions of Mr. Jowett and his
accomplices in 'free handling,'&mdash;based evidently on
a misconception of the meaning of 2 Cor. iii. 6. The
contrast recurs at pp.&nbsp;36, 357, 375, 425, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>(&#946;) Still bent on shewing that Inspiration does not
secure Scripture from blots and blemishes, Mr. Jowett
proceeds as follows. (I must present him to the reader,
for a short space, <i>in extenso</i>; since by no other expedient
can the complicated fallacies of his very intricate
and perverse method be exposed.)</p>

<p>"Inspiration is a fact which we infer from the
study of Scripture,&mdash;not of one portion only, but of
the whole." (p.&nbsp;347.) (Now even <i>this</i> is not a correct
way of stating the case. Still, because the words <i>may</i>
bear an honourable sense, we pass on.)&mdash;"Obviously
then, it embraces writings of very different kinds,&mdash;the
book of Esther, for example, or the Song of Solomon,
as well as the Gospel of St. John." (That <i>the
volume</i> of Inspiration is of this complex character,
and that <i>it</i> embraces writings so diverse, is beyond
dispute.)&mdash;"It is reconcileable with the mixed good
and evil of the characters of the Old Testament, which
nevertheless does not exclude them from the favour
of <span class="smcap">God</span>." (<i>Why</i> the Inspiration of a writer should
not be 'reconcileable' with <i>any</i> amount of wickedness
in the persons about whom he writes,&mdash;I am quite at
a loss to perceive. Neither do I see why "the mixed
good and evil" of certain "characters of the Old Testament,"
(or of the New either,) should "exclude them
from the favour of <span class="smcap">God</span>." What else becomes of your
hope, and mine, of Eternal Life?)&mdash;"Inspiration is
also reconcileable," (he proceeds,)&mdash;"with the attribution
to the Divine Being of <i>actions at variance with
that higher revelation which He has given of Himself in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cc" id="Page_cc">[cc]</a></span>the Gospel</i>." (Is this meant as an insult to "the
Divine Being?" or simply as a slur on Revelation?
Either way, we reject the charge with indignation<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.)&mdash;"It
is not inconsistent with imperfect or opposite
aspects of the Truth, as in the Book of Job or Ecclesiastes:"
(Nothing which comes from <span class="smcap">God</span> should be
called "imperfect:" but why <i>different</i> aspects of the
Truth should not be brought out, by different writers,
as by St. Paul and by James,&mdash;it is hard to see.)&mdash;"With
variations of fact in the Gospels, or the Books of Kings
and Chronicles:" (We do not admit that Inspiration
is consistent with "variations of <i>fact;</i>" but with <i>different
versions</i> of the same incident, it is confessedly
compatible.)&mdash;"With inaccuracies of language in the
Epistles of St. Paul." (With <i>grammatical inelegancies</i>,
no doubt; but not with <i>logical inaccuracies</i>.)&mdash;"For
these are all found in Scripture:" (This statement,
by the way, should have been substantiated by at
least as many references as there are heads in the
indictment,)&mdash;"neither is there any reason why they
should not be; except a general impression that
Scripture ought to have been written in a way different
from what it has." (Just as if Mankind for 1800
years had been the victims of an <i>&agrave; priori</i> conception
as to <i>how</i> Holy Scripture <i>ought to have been</i> written!)&mdash;"A
principle of progressive revelation admits them
all; and this is already contained in the words of our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, 'Moses because of the hardness of your
hearts;' or even in the Old Testament, 'Henceforth
there shall be no more this proverb in the house of
Israel?'" (O if Catholic writers were to expound Holy
Scripture with the license of <i>these</i> gentlemen!...
That the scheme of Revelation has been progressive, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cci" id="Page_cci">[cci]</a></span>a Theological truism. What that has to do with the
question in hand, I see not.)&mdash;"For what is progressive
is necessarily imperfect in its earlier stages:"
("Imperfect" in what sense?)&mdash;"and <i>even erring</i> to
those who come after." (No, not in <i>that</i> sense imperfect,
certainly!) ... "There is no more reason why
<i>imperfect narratives</i> should be excluded from Scripture
than imperfect grammar; no more ground for expecting
that the New Testament would be logical or Aristotelian
in form, than that it would be written in
Attic Greek." (Now <i>why</i> this cloudy shuffling about
"imperfect narratives,"&mdash;instead of saying <i>what you
mean</i>, like a man! Further,&mdash;Is Mr. Jowett so weak as
not to perceive that there is <i>no force whatever</i> in his
supposed parallel? The Discourses of the Incarnate
<span class="smcap">Son</span>, for instance, are certainly anything but "Aristotelian
in form." His dialect,&mdash;(Angels bowed to
catch it, I nothing doubt!)&mdash;was that of the despised
Galilee. But need <i>the teaching it conveyed</i> have <i>therefore</i>
been "imperfect?" Why may not the least perfect
<i>Greek</i> be the vehicle for the more perfect <i>Doctrine</i>?
What connexion is there between the casket and the
jewel which it encloses?)</p>

<p>(&#947;) The Reverend writer promises us help, from
"another consideration which has been neglected by
writers on this subject." (The announcement makes
us attentive.)&mdash;"It is this,&mdash;that any true Doctrine
of Inspiration must conform to all well-ascertained
facts of History or of Science." (We scarcely see the
drift of this ill-worded proposition; but are disposed
to assent.)&mdash;"The same fact cannot be true and untrue,"
(Who ever supposed that it could?)&mdash;"any
more than the same words can have two opposite
meanings." (But why glide at once into a gross fal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccii" id="Page_ccii">[ccii]</a></span>sity?
Are there not plenty of words and speeches,
of the kind called 'equivocal' or 'ambiguous,' which
are of this nature? I am content to refer this writer
to <i>his own pages</i>, for the abundant refutation of his
own assertion. No man in the world knows better
than Mr. Jowett that "<i>the same words can have two
opposite meanings</i>.") "The same fact cannot be true
in Religion, when seen by the light of Faith; and
untrue in Science, when looked at through the medium
of evidence or experiment." (Why not? For
example,&mdash;'He maketh His Sun to rise.' 'If <span class="smcap">God</span> so
clothe the grass of the field.' '<span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let there
be light.' Who sees not that the view which Faith
and which Physical Science respectively take of the
same phenomenon, may essentially differ?)&mdash;"It is
ridiculous to suppose that the Sun goes round the
Earth in the same sense in which the Earth goes
round the Sun;" (Very ridiculous.)&mdash;"or that the
world appears to have existed, but has not existed,
during the vast epochs of which Geology speaks to
us." (Leave out the words, "appears to have," and
this also is undeniable.)&mdash;"But if so, there is no need
of elaborate reconcilements of Revelation and Science."
(How does that follow? If what is thought to be Divinely
revealed, and what is thought to be scientifically
ascertained, seem to be conflicting truths,&mdash;why
should not an effort be made to reconcile them?)
"They reconcile themselves the moment any scientific
truth is distinctly ascertained." (Yes: by the Human
simply trying to thrust the Divine out of doors!)&mdash;"As
the idea of Nature enlarges, the idea of Revelation
also enlarges:" (I deny that there is any such
intimate connexion as this author supposes between
Physical Science and Divinity,)&mdash;"it was a temporary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cciii" id="Page_cciii">[cciii]</a></span>misunderstanding which severed them." (But <i>when</i>
were Nature and Revelation ever for an instant
"severed?")&mdash;"And as the knowledge of Nature
which is possessed by the few is communicated in its
leading features at least, to the many, they will receive
it with a higher conception of the ways of <span class="smcap">God</span>
to Man. It may hereafter appear as natural to the
majority of Mankind to see the Providence of <span class="smcap">God</span> in
the order of the world, as it once was to appeal to interruptions
of it." (p.&nbsp;349.) (As if an increased <i>knowledge
of Nature</i> were the condition of Theological enlightenment!...
I presume that the latter clause,&mdash;so
hazy and the reverse of obvious in its meaning!&mdash;is
intended to convey the sentiment which Mr. Baden
Powell expresses as follows:&mdash;"The inevitable progress
of research must, within a longer or shorter
period, unravel <i>all that seems most marvellous</i>; and
what is at present least understood will become as
familiarly known to the Science of the future, as those
points which a few centuries ago were involved in
equal obscurity, but now are thoroughly understood<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.")</p>

<p>(&#948;) We are next informed "that there are a class
of scientific facts with which popular opinions on Theology
often conflict.... Such especially are the facts
relating to the formation of the Earth and the beginnings
of the Human Race." (p.&nbsp;349.) (And pray,
what "<i>facts</i>" are these, relative to the "beginnings
of the Human Race," which conflict with Scripture?) ...
"Almost all intelligent persons are agreed that
the earth has existed for myriads of ages:" (Which is
perfectly true.)&mdash;"The best informed are of opinion
that the history of nations extends back <i>some thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cciv" id="Page_cciv">[cciv]</a></span>years</i> before the Mosaic Chronology." (Which is decidedly
false.)&mdash;"Recent discoveries in Geology <i>may
perhaps</i> open a further vista of existence for the human
species; while <i>it is possible, and may one day be
known</i>, that Mankind spread not from one but from
many centres over the globe; or, (as others say,) that
the supply of links which are at present wanting in
the chain of animal life <i>may lead</i> to new conclusions
respecting the origin of Man." (A cool way, this, of
anticipating that something which '<i>may</i>'&mdash;(or <i>may
not!</i>)&mdash;be discovered hereafter, will demonstrate that
the beginning of the Bible is all a fable!)&mdash;"Now,"
(proceeds our author,) "let it be granted that" "<i>the
proof</i> of some of these facts, especially of those last-mentioned,
<i>is wanting</i>; still it is a false policy to set
up Inspiration or Revelation <i>in opposition to them</i>, a
principle which can have <i>no influence on them</i>, and
should be kept rather out of their way." (Considerate
man!) "The Sciences of Geology and comparative
Philology are steadily gaining ground. Many of the
guesses of twenty years ago have been certainties;
and the guesses of to-day may hereafter become so.
Shall we peril Religion&nbsp;(!) on the possibility of their
untruth? on such a cast to stake the life of Man, implies
not only a recklessness of facts&nbsp;(!), but a misunderstanding
of the nature of the Gospel. If it is
fortunate for Science, it is perhaps more fortunate for
Christian Truth, that the admission of Galileo's discovery
has for ever settled the principle of the relations
between them."&mdash;(pp.&nbsp;349-50.) ...</p>

<p>Now, what a curious picture of a perverse and
crooked mind does such a sentence exhibit! Divine
Revelation can "<i>have no influence</i>" of course, on facts
of <i>any</i> kind, (including facts in Physical Science,)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccv" id="Page_ccv">[ccv]</a></span>when once those facts have been well ascertained.
But, <i>in the entire absence of such facts</i>, why should we
refuse to listen to the <i>well ascertained Revelation of
<span class="smcap">God</span></i>? Nothing is more emphatic, for example, than
the Divine declaration that the whole Human family
is derived from a single pair; and the origin of Man
is plainly set down in Genesis. Why then oppose to
this, the confessedly <i>undiscovered</i> fact that "mankind
spread from many centres;" and the purely speculative
possibility that, hereafter, a certain theory "<i>may
lead</i> to new conclusions respecting the origin of Man?"&mdash;As
for "Religion" being "perilled on the possibility"
of the truth or untruth of the Sciences of Geology
and comparative Philology;&mdash;we really would
submit that <i><span class="smcap">God</span> may be safely left to take care of His
own;</i> and that "peril," there is,&mdash;there <i>can</i> be,&mdash;<i>none!</i></p>

<p>And then, the maudlin tenderness of an "Essayist
and Reviewer" (of all persons in the world!) for "<i>the
life of Man</i>,"&mdash;meaning thereby his Christian hope,
and Faith in the <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>!... As if, (first,) Man's
"<i>Life</i>" were <i>in any sense</i> endangered, by our upholding
the honour and authority of the Bible! And
(secondly,) as if the age had shewn itself in the least
degree impatient of scientific investigation! And
(thirdly,) as if Religion depended, or could be made
to depend, on Physical phenomena, or on the progress
of Natural Science, <i>at all!</i> ... I scruple not to say
that arguments like these impress me with the meanest
opinion of Mr. Jowett's intellectual powers: while
they prove to demonstration that he does not in the
least understand the subject on which he yet writes
with such feeble vehemence.</p>

<p>But I may not proceed any further, or my pages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccvi" id="Page_ccvi">[ccvi]</a></span>will equal in extent those of the gentleman already
named. Indeed, to follow that most confused of
thinkers, and crooked of disputants, through all his
perverse pages; to expose his habitual paltry evasive
dodging,&mdash;his shifting equivocations,&mdash;his misapplications
of Scripture,&mdash;his unworthy insinuations,&mdash;his
plaintive puerilities of thought and sentiment;&mdash;would
require a thick volume.&mdash;If Mr. Jowett does
not deny the Personality of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, he
ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself for penning
sentences which can lead to no other inference.
For he ought to know that when men talk of words
"receiving <i>a more exact meaning than they will truly
bear</i>;" and of what "is <i>spoken in a figure</i> being construed
with the severity of a logical statement, while
<i>passages of an opposite tenour are overlooked or set
aside</i>:"&mdash;(p.&nbsp;360.) men mean to repudiate the doctrine
which those words are thought to convey; not to
imply their acceptance of it.&mdash;So again, if Mr. Jowett
holds the doctrine of Original Sin, he ought to be
heartily ashamed of himself for having insinuated that
it depends "on <i>two figurative expressions of St. Paul
to which there is no parallel in any other part of Scripture</i>."
(p.&nbsp;361.)&mdash;Nor, however moderate his attainments
as a teacher of Divinity, ought he to be capable
of putting forth such a notorious misstatement as that
the doctrine of Infant Baptism <i>rests upon a verse in
the Acts</i> (xvi. 33,)&mdash;which verse has really <i>nothing
whatever to do with the question</i><a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. (p.&nbsp;360.)</p>

<p>Professor Jowett shuts up his Essay with a passage
which, for a certain amount of tender pathos in the
sentiment, has been often quoted, and sometimes admired,
He says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccvii" id="Page_ccvii">[ccvii]</a></span>
"The suspicion or difficulty which attends critical
inquiries is no reason for doubting their value. The
Scripture nowhere leads us to suppose that the circumstance
of all men speaking well of us is any
ground for supposing that we are acceptable in the
sight of God. And there is no reason why the condemnation
of others should be witnessed to by our
own conscience. Perhaps it may be true that, owing
to the jealousy or fear of some, the reticence of others,
the terrorism of a few, we may not always find it easy
to regard these subjects with calmness and judgment.
But, on the other hand, these accidental circumstances
have nothing to do with the question at issue; they
cannot have the slightest influence on the meaning of
words, or on the truth of facts....</p>

<p>"Lastly, there is some nobler idea of truth than is
supplied by the opinion of mankind in general, or the
voice of parties in a Church. Every one, whether a
student of Theology or not, has need to make war
against his prejudices no less than against his passions;
and, in the religious teacher, the first is even
more necessary than the last.... He who takes the
prevailing opinions of Christians and decks them out
in their gayest colours,&mdash;who reflects the better mind
of the world to itself&mdash;is likely to be its favourite
teacher. In that ministry of the Gospel, even when
assuming forms repulsive to persons of education&nbsp;(!),
no doubt the good is far greater than the error or harm.
But there is also a deeper work which is not dependent
on the opinions of men, in which many elements
combine, some alien to Religion, or accidentally at
variance with it. That work can hardly expect to
win much popular favour, so far as it runs counter to
the feelings of religious parties. But he who bears a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccviii" id="Page_ccviii">[ccviii]</a></span>part in it may feel a confidence, which no popular
caresses or religious sympathy could inspire, that he
has by a Divine help been enabled to plant his foot
somewhere beyond the waves of Time. He may depart
hence before the natural term, worn out with intellectual
toil; regarded with suspicion by many of his
contemporaries; yet not without a sure hope that the
love of Truth, which men of saintly lives often seem
to slight, is, nevertheless, accepted before <span class="smcap">God</span>."&mdash;(pp.
432-3.)</p>

<p>My respect for a fellow-man induces me to offer
a few remarks on all this.</p>

<p>Let me be permitted then to declare that I am as
incapable as any one who ever breathed the air of this
lower world, of making light of the sentiments of true
genius. I can respond with my whole heart to the
passion-stricken cry of one who, when "regarded with
suspicion by many of his contemporaries," is observed
to hail his fellows with confidence, across the gulph of
Time; and as it were implore them, after many days,
to do him right. Nay, were I to behold a man of
splendid, but misguided powers, elaborating from <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Word a plausible system of his own, whereby to bring
back the Golden Age to suffering Humanity; and insisting
that he beheld in the common revelations of
the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, the unsuspected outlines of such a form
of polity as Man never dreamed of,&mdash;(nor, it may be,
Angels either;)&mdash;I should experience a kind of generous
sympathy with this bright-eyed enthusiast; even
while I proceeded to test his wild dream by what I
believed to be the standard of right Reason. Then,
as the specious fabric was seen suddenly to collapse
and melt away, should I not, with affectionate sorrow,
secretly mourn that such brilliant parts had not been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccix" id="Page_ccix">[ccix]</a></span>enlisted on the side of Truth? and feel as if I could
have been content to go about for life maimed in body,
or hopelessly impoverished in estate, if so great a disaster
could but have been prevented as the loss of one
who ought to have been a standard-bearer in Israel?</p>

<p>Once more. Although the cold shade of unbelief
has never for an instant, (thank <span class="smcap">God</span>!) darkened my
spirit; so that one may not be very apt to sympathize
with men who walk about hampered with a doubt;
yet, were one to know, (as one has often known,&mdash;<i>too</i>
often, alas!) that the arrow was rankling in a friend's
heart,&mdash;who by consequence shunned the society of
his fellows, and walked in moody abstraction,&mdash;looking
as if life had lost its charm, and as if nothing on
the earth's surface were any longer to him a joy;&mdash;would
one not be the first to go after such a sufferer;
and seek whether a firm hand and steady eye might
not avail to extract the poisoned shaft? If that might
not be, at least by daily acts of unaltered kindness,
and the ways which brotherly sympathy suggests,
<i>who</i> would not strive to recover such an one? If
all other arts proved unavailing, it would remain for
a man with the ordinary instincts of humanity, in
silence and sorrow at least, to look on, while the
solitary doubter was paying the bitter penalty,&mdash;doubtless,
of his sin.</p>

<p>But how widely different,&mdash;rather, how utterly
dissimilar,&mdash;is the phenomenon before us! Here is
a singularly confused and shallow thinker oppressed
with the vastness of his discovery, that the Bible&mdash;<i>has
nothing in it!</i> Here is a Clergyman of the Church
of England, and a Lecturer in Divinity, whose difficulty
is how he shall convince the world that the
Bible is&mdash;<i>like any other book!</i> Here is the sceptical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccx" id="Page_ccx">[ccx]</a></span>fellow of a College, conspiring with six others, to
produce a volume of which Germany itself, (having
changed its mind,) would already be ashamed!... Mr.
Jowett is enthusiastic for <i>a negation!</i> Without
belief himself, he cannot rest because Christendom
has, on the whole, a good deal of belief remaining!
If he may but <i>unsettle somebody's mind</i>,&mdash;his Essay
will have achieved its purpose, and its author will
not have lived in vain!... Sublime privilege for
"the only man in the University of Oxford who" is
said to "exercise a moral and spiritual influence at all
corresponding to that which was once wielded by John
Henry Newman<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>!"</p>

<p>I shall be thought a very profane person, I dare
say, by the friends and apologists of Mr. Jowett, if
I avow that the passage with which he concludes his
Essay, instead of sounding in my ears like the plaintive
death-song of departing Genius, sounds to me
like nothing so much as the piteous whine of a schoolboy
who knows that he <i>deserves</i> chastisement, and
perceives that he is about to experience his deserts.
System, or Theory, the Reverend Gentleman has none
to propose. Views, except negative ones, Mr. Jowett
is altogether guiltless of. Can anybody in his senses
suppose that a man "has, by a Divine help&nbsp;(!), been
enabled to plant his foot <i>somewhere beyond the waves
of Time</i>," (p.&nbsp;433,) who doubts everything, and believes
nothing? Can any one of sane mind dream
that posterity will come to the rescue of a man who,
when he is asked for his story, rejoins, (with a well-known
needy mechanic,) that he has "none to tell,
Sir?" <i>What</i> then is posterity to vindicate? <i>What</i>
has the Regius Professor of Greek written so many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxi" id="Page_ccxi">[ccxi]</a></span>weak pages to prove? Just nothing! If Mr. Jowett's
Essay could enforce the message it carries, the result
would simply be that the world would become <i>dis</i>believers
in the Inspiration of the Bible: they would
<i>dis</i>believe that Scripture has any sense but that which
lies on the surface: they would therefore <i>dis</i>believe
the Prophets and Evangelists and Apostles of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>:
they would <i>dis</i>believe the words of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus
Christ</span> Himself!... Has Mr. Jowett, then, grown
grey under the laborious process of arriving at this
series of negations? When he anticipates "departing
hence before the natural term," does he mean that he
is "<i>worn out with the intellectual toil</i>" of propounding
<i>nothing!</i> and that he expects the sympathy and gratitude
of posterity for what he has propounded?</p>

<p>But this is not all. Instead of coming abroad, (if
come abroad he must,) in that garb of humility which
befits doubt,&mdash;that self-distrust which becomes one
whose fault, or whose misfortune it is, that he simply
cannot believe,&mdash;Mr. Jowett assumes throughout, the
insolent air of intellectual superiority; the tone of one
at whose bidding Theology must absolutely 'keep
moving.' A truncheon and a number on his collar,
alone seem wanting. The menacing voice, and authoritative
air, are certainly not away,&mdash;as I proceed to
shew.</p>

<p>"It may be observed that a change in some of the
prevailing modes of Interpretation, is not so much
a matter of expediency as <i>of necessity</i>. The original
meaning of Scripture <i>is beginning to be understood</i>."
(p.&nbsp;418.)</p>

<p>"Criticism has <i>far more power</i> than it formerly had.
It has spread itself over ancient, and even modern
history.... <i>Whether Scripture can be made an exception
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxii" id="Page_ccxii">[ccxii]</a></span>to other ancient writings</i>, now that the nature of both
is more understood; whether ... <i>the views of the last
century will hold out</i>,&mdash;these are questions respecting
which" (p.&nbsp;420.) it is hard to judge.</p>

<p>"It has to be considered whether the intellectual
forms under which Christianity has been described,
may not also be <i>in a state of transition</i>." (p.&nbsp;420.)</p>

<p>"Now, as <i>the Interpretation of Scripture is receiving
another character</i>, it seems that distinctions of Theology
which were in great measure based on old Interpretations,
are <i>beginning to fade away</i>." ... "There are
other signs that times are changing, and we are
changing too." (p.&nbsp;421.)</p>

<p>"These reflections bring us back to the question
with which we began,&mdash;<i>What effect will the critical
Interpretation of Scripture have on Theology?</i>" (p.&nbsp;422.)</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;"As the time has come when it is no
longer possible to ignore the results of criticism, it is
of importance that Christianity should be seen to be
in harmony with them." (p.&nbsp;374.) (The sentences
which immediately follow shall be exhibited in distinct
paragraphs, in order that they may separately enjoy
admiration. Each is a gem or a curiosity in its way.)</p>

<p>"That objections to some received views <i>should be
valid</i>, and yet that they should be always held up as
<i>the objections of Infidels</i>,&mdash;is a mischief to the Christian
cause."</p>

<p>"It is a mischief that critical observations which
any intelligent man can make for himself&nbsp;(!), should
be ascribed to Atheism or Unbelief."</p>

<p>"It would be a strange and almost incredible thing
that the Gospel, which at first made war only on the
vices of mankind, should now be <i>opposed</i> to one of the
highest and rarest of human virtues,&mdash;<i>the love of Truth</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxiii" id="Page_ccxiii">[ccxiii]</a></span>
"And that in the present day the great object of
Christianity should be, not to change the lives of men,
but to prevent them from changing their opinions;
<i>that</i> would be a singular inversion of the purposes for
which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> came into the world."</p>

<p>We are really constrained to pause for a moment,
and to inquire what this last sentence means. Are
not "the lives of men" mainly <i>dependent</i> on "their
opinions?" Why then contrast the two? And <i>which</i>
of our "opinions" does Mr. Jowett desire to see
changed? Would he have us resign our belief in
the Atonement? reject the Divinity of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>? deny
the Personality of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>? put the Bible on
a level with Sophocles and Plato? ridicule the idea of
Inspiration?... How would it be a "singular inversion
of the purposes of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> Coming," that Christianity
should "prevent" mankind from "changing" such
"opinions" as <i>these?</i></p>

<p>"The Christian religion is in a false position when
<i>all the tendencies of knowledge are opposed to it</i>." (<i>All
the tendencies of knowledge, then, are opposed to the
Christian Religion!</i>)</p>

<p>"Such a position cannot be long maintained, or can
only end in the withdrawal of the educated classes
from the influences of Religion." (So we are to look
for "<i>the withdrawal of the educated classes from the
influences of Religion</i><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>!")
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxiv" id="Page_ccxiv">[ccxiv]</a></span>After anticipating "religious dissolution," because
of "the progress of ideas,&nbsp;(!) with which Christian
teachers seem to be ill at ease,"&nbsp;(!) Mr. Jowett, (who
we presume is speaking of himself,) says, "Time was
when the Gospel was before the Age:" (The Gospel is
therefore now <i>behind</i> the age!)&mdash;"when the difficulties
of Christianity were difficulties of the heart only:"
(When was that?)&mdash;"and <i>the highest minds</i> found in
its truths not only the rule of their lives, but a well-spring
of intellectual delight." (All this then has
<i>ceased to be the case!</i> "The highest minds" being of
course represented by&mdash;Mr. Jowett!)</p>

<p>"Is it to be held a thing impossible that the Christian
Religion, instead of shrinking into itself,&nbsp;(!) may
again <i>embrace the thoughts of men upon the earth?</i>"
(that is to say, "embrace the thoughts" of&mdash;Mr.
Jowett!)&mdash;"Or is it true that <i>since the Reformation
'all intellect has gone the other way'</i>?"</p>

<p>"But for the faith that the Gospel might win again
the minds of <i>intellectual men</i>," (such men as Mr.
Jowett?)&mdash;"it would be better to leave Religion to
itself, instead of attempting to draw them together."
(p.&nbsp;376.)</p>

<p>Now this kind of language, in daily life, would be
called sheer impertinence; and the person who could
talk so before educated gentlemen would probably
receive an intimation that he was making himself
offensive. He would certainly be looked upon as
a weak and conceited person. I really am unable to
see why things should be <i>written and printed</i> which no
one would presume <i>to say</i>! ... Encircled by a little
atmosphere of fog of his own creating, Mr. Jowett is
evidently under the delusion that his own confused
vision and misty language are the result of the giddy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxv" id="Page_ccxv">[ccxv]</a></span>eminence to which, (leaving his fellow-mortals far
behind him,) he has contrived, all alone, to soar.
He anticipates the complaint of some unhappy disciple,
that he "experiences a sort of shrinking or
dizziness at the prospect which is opening before
him:" whereupon Mr. Jowett invites the "highly educated
young man," (p.&nbsp;373,) to consider "that he may
possibly not be the person who is called upon to pursue
such inquiries." Who are they <i>for</i>, then? "No man
should busy himself with them who has not clearness
of mind enough to see things as they are." (p.&nbsp;430.)
The clearness of mind, for example, which belongs
to Mr. Jowett!</p>

<p>True enough it is that had such airs been assumed
by such an one as Richard Hooker, who achieved the
first four books of his 'Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity'
before he was 40; and dying in his 46th year, proved
himself to be the greatest genius of his age:&mdash;had
language like Mr. Jowett's been found on the lips of
Joseph Butler, who when he was 44 produced his
immortal 'Analagy,' and at the age of 26 delivered
his famous Rolls 'Sermons:'&mdash;had Bishop Bull been
betrayed into the language of self-complacency when,
at the age of 35, he made himself famous by his 'Harmonia
Apostolica:'&mdash;the proceeding would have been
intelligible, however much one might have lamented
such an exhibition of weakness.... But when the
speaker proves to be one of the very shallowest of
thinkers, and most confused of reasoners;&mdash;a man
who, although grey-headed, has done nothing whatever
for Literature, sacred or profane;&mdash;nor indeed is
known out of Oxford except for having been thought
to deny the Doctrine of the Atonement;&mdash;a man
who dogmatizes in a Science of which he clearly does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxvi" id="Page_ccxvi">[ccxvi]</a></span>not know so much as the very alphabet; and presumes
to dispute about a Bible which he has evidently
not read with the attention which is due even to a
first-rate uninspired book;&mdash;<i>then</i>, one's displeasure
and impatience assume the form of indignation and
disgust. The Divine who, purposing to prove that
Holy Scripture is in kind like any other book, does
so <i>by inveighing against those who treat it differently</i>;
and indeed, on every occasion, <i>assumes as proved</i> the
thing he has <i>to prove</i><a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>:&mdash;is obviously the very man
to vaunt the privileges of the intellect. The student
of the Bible who mistakes the utterance of a lying
prophet for the language of Amos, and then boldly
charges the lie upon the inspired author of a book of
Canonical Scripture;&mdash;is of course a proper person to
discuss the Prophetic Canon. The gentleman who
flatters himself that he has been <i>sweeping the house</i> to
find <i>the pearl of great price</i>, (p.&nbsp;414,) is a very pretty
person, truly, to lecture about the Gospel!... I
forbear reproaching Mr. Jowett with his <i>invariable</i>
misapplications or misapprehensions of the meaning of
Scripture: his false glosses, and truly preposterous
specimens of exegesis<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>. I am content to take leave
of him, while he is flattering himself that he has
"<i>found the pearl of great price, after sweeping the
house</i>:" (p.&nbsp;414:) and under that melancholy delusion,
I fear he must be left,&mdash;holding the broom in his hands.</p>

<p>On a review of these Seven Essays, few things strike
one more forcibly than the utterly untenable ground
occupied by their authors. They are "in a position
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxvii" id="Page_ccxvii">[ccxvii]</a></span>in which it is impossible to remain. The theory of
Mr. Jowett and his fellows is as false to philosophy
as to the Church of England. More may be true, or
less; but to attempt to halt where they would stop is
a simple absurdity<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>."</p>

<p>To exactness of method or System, their work
can hardly pretend; and yet they <i>have</i> a system,&mdash;which
has only not been rounded into symmetry, by
the singular circumstance that these seven writers
"have written in entire independence of one another,
and without concert or comparison." They <i>avow a
common purpose</i>, however; for they "hope" that their
joint labours "will be received as an attempt to illustrate,"
(whatever <i>that</i> may mean,) "the advantage
derivable to the cause of Religion and Moral Truth"
from what they have here attempted; and which they
justly characterize as "<i>free handling</i>." Putting oneself
in their position, it is easy to imagine the sorrow
and concern,&mdash;the <i>horror</i> rather,&mdash;with which a good
man, when the first edition of 'Essays and Reviews'
made its appearance, would have discovered the kind
of complicity into which he had been inadvertently
betrayed; and how eagerly he would have withdrawn
from a literary partnership which had resulted so disastrously.
At the end of nine large editions, however,
the corporate responsibility of each individual
author has become fully established; and besides the
many proofs of sympathy between the several authors
which these pages contain<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>, it is no longer doubtful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxviii" id="Page_ccxviii">[ccxviii]</a></span>that the sentiments of the work are to be quoted without
reference to the individual writers. It would be
unfair to assume that not one of these seven men has
had the manliness to avow that his own individual
convictions are opposed to those of his fellows. We
are compelled to regard their joint labours as <i>one</i> production.
It is the <i>corporate efficacy</i> of the several contributions
which constitutes the chief criminality of
the volume. It is to the respectability and weight of
the <i>conjoined</i> names of its authors, and to their <i>combined</i>
efforts, that 'Essays and Reviews' are indebted for all
their power.</p>

<p>What then is the system, or theory, or view, advocated
by these seven Authors?&mdash;They are all agreed
that we are "placed evidently at an epoch when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxix" id="Page_ccxix">[ccxix]</a></span>Humanity finds itself under new conditions, to form
some definite conception to ourselves of the way in
which Christianity is henceforward to act upon the
world which is our own." (p.&nbsp;158.) To do this, we
must emerge from our "narrow chamber of Doctrinal
and Ecclesiastical prepossessions." (<i>Ibid.</i>) Accordingly,
we find insinuated "a very wide-spread alienation,
both in educated and uneducated persons, from
the Christianity which is ordinarily presented in our
Churches and Chapels." (p.&nbsp;150.) There has been
"a spontaneous recoil." (p.&nbsp;151.) We cannot "resist
the tide of civilization on which we are borne." (p.
412.) "The time has come when it is no longer possible
to ignore the results of criticism." It is therefore
"of importance that Christianity should be seen
to be in harmony with them." (p.&nbsp;374.) "The arguments
of our genuine critics, with the convictions of
our most learned clergy" (p.&nbsp;66) are all opposed to
the actual teaching of the Church. Meantime, "the
Christian Religion is in a false position when all the
tendencies of knowledge are opposed to it." (p.&nbsp;374.)
"Time was when the Gospel was before the age: ...
when the highest minds found in its truths not only
the rule of their lives, but a well-spring of intellectual
delight. Is it to be held a thing impossible that the
Christian Religion may again embrace the thoughts
of men upon the earth?" (pp.&nbsp;374-5.)</p>

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smcap">the Bible</span> is a stubborn fact in
the way of the new Religion. Nay, the English <i>Book
of Common Prayer</i> is a great hindrance; for those
"formul&aelig; of past thinkings, have long lost all sense of
any kind;" (p.&nbsp;297;) so that the Prayer-book "is on
the way to become a useless encumbrance, the rubbish
of the past, blocking the road." (<i>Ibid.</i>) But the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxx" id="Page_ccxx">[ccxx]</a></span>Prayer-book confessedly stands on a different footing
from the Bible. The Bible erects itself hopelessly in the
way of "the negative religion." (p.&nbsp;151.) O those many
prophecies, which for 4000 long years sustained the
faith of <span class="smcap">God's</span> chosen people, and at last found fulfilment
in the person of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, or in the circumstances which
attended the establishment of His Kingdom! O that
glorious retinue of types and shadows which heralded
<span class="smcap">Messiah's</span> approach!... And then,&mdash;O the miraculous
evidence which attested to the reality of His Divinity<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>!
O the confirmation, (to those who needed it,) when He
walked the water, and stilled the storm, and cast out
devils by His word, and by one strong cry broke the
gates of Death, and caused Lazarus to "Come forth!"
... O the solemn <i>independent</i> testimony borne by
Creeds, from the very birthday of Christianity,&mdash;(whether
planted in Syria or in Asia Minor, in Africa
or in Italy, in Greece or in Gaul; "in Germany or in
Spain, among the Celts or in the far East, in Egypt
or in Libya, or in the middle regions of the globe<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.")
Lastly,&mdash;O the adoring voice of the whole Church
Catholic throughout the world, for many a succeeding
century,&mdash;translating, expounding, defining, explaining,
defending to the death!... How shall all this
formidable mass of evidence possibly be set aside?</p>

<p>It is plain that Prophecy must be evacuated of its
meaning; or rather, must be denied entirely: and to
do this, falls to the share of the vulgar and violent
Vice-Principal of Lampeter College. Disprove he
cannot; so he sneers and rails and blusters instead.
Prophecy, he calls "omniscience;" "a notion of foresight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxi" id="Page_ccxxi">[ccxxi]</a></span>by vision of particulars;" (p.&nbsp;70;) "a kind of
clairvoyance," (p.&nbsp;70,) and "literal prognostication."
(p.&nbsp;65.) Mr. Jowett (as we have lately seen<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>,) lends
plaintive help: but indeed Dr. Williams does not lack
supporters.</p>

<p>To deny the truth of Miracles falls to the lot of
the Savilian Professor of Astronomy. His method
has the merit of extreme simplicity: for it is based
on the ground that, in the writer's opinion, Miracles
are impossible,&mdash;which of course must be held to be
decisive of the question.</p>

<p>The battle against the Inspiration of the Word of
<span class="smcap">God</span> is reserved for the Regius Professor of Greek;
who requires for his purpose twice the space of any
of his fellows. <i>His</i> method is also of the simplest
kind, when divested of its many encumbrances. He
simply <i>assumes it as proved</i> that the Bible is a book
not essentially different from Sophocles and Plato.
In other words he <i>assumes</i> that the Bible is not inspired;
and reproaches, pities, or sneers at every one
who is not of his opinion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, What <i>is</i> Prophecy? What <i>are</i>
Miracles? Of what sort is that Bible which has imposed
upon mankind so grossly, and so long? They
are <i>facts</i>, and must be explained. What are they?
Prophecy, then, is "<i>only the power of seeing the ideal
in the actual</i>, or of tracing the Divine Government
in the movements of men." (p.&nbsp;70.) As for Miracles,
"their evidential force is wholly <i>relative</i> to the apprehensions
of the parties addressed ... Columbus'
prediction of the Eclipse to the native islanders," (p.
115,) is advanced as an illustration of the nature of
the argument from Miracles. By whatever method
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxii" id="Page_ccxxii">[ccxxii]</a></span>the Bible has attained its present footing in the world,
it is a book which has been hitherto misunderstood;
and it must plainly be dealt with after a new fashion.
Our Lord's Incarnation, Temptation, Death and Burial,
Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven,&mdash;all His
Miracles, in short, will be best interpreted <i>Ideologically</i>;
in other words, by a principle "which resolves
into an ideal the whole of the historical and doctrinal
person of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>." (p.&nbsp;200.) So interpreted, "the
Gospel may win again the minds of intellectual men;"
(p.&nbsp;376;) but it will find it no easy matter. There is
in fact "a higher wisdom" than the Gospel, "which
is known to those who are perfect,"&mdash;"<i>that</i> reconcilement,"
namely, "of Faith and Knowledge which may
be termed Christian Philosophy." (p.&nbsp;413.)</p>

<p>The great object, in short, is to bring about "a reconciliation"
(p.&nbsp;375,) between "the minds of intellectual
men" (p.&nbsp;376,) and Christianity. Such a
reconciliation is to be regarded as a "restoration
of belief." (p.&nbsp;375.) And it is to be effected by
"taking away some of the external supports, because
they are not needed and do harm: also because they
interfere with the meaning." (p.&nbsp;375.)&mdash;Those "external
supports" are (1)&nbsp;a belief in the Inspiration of
the Bible;&mdash;(2)&nbsp;the writings of the Fathers and
Doctors of the Church;&mdash;(3)&nbsp;Creeds and the decisions
of Councils;&mdash;(4)&nbsp;the works of Anglican Divines;&mdash;(5)&nbsp;Learning;
(p.&nbsp;337;)&mdash;(6)&nbsp;a profound acquaintance
with the Greek language; (p.&nbsp;393;)&mdash;(7)&nbsp;a minute
knowledge of Greek Grammar; (p.&nbsp;391;)&mdash;(8)&nbsp;the
Doctrine of the Greek Article;&mdash;(9)&nbsp;the free use of
the parallel passages.... The Bible, when interpreted
by any self-relying young man who knows a little
Greek, and attends to the meaning <i>of words</i>,&mdash;will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxiii" id="Page_ccxxiii">[ccxxiii]</a></span>seen in all the freshness of its early beauty, like an
old picture which has been recently cleaned. "A
new interest" will be excited by this new Bible,
which will "make for itself a new kind of authority."
By being thus literally interpreted, it will be transformed
into "a spirit." Then, (but not before) the
Bible will enjoy the sublime satisfaction of keeping
pace with the Age. It may so, even yet, "embrace
the thoughts of men upon the earth."</p>

<p>But what kind of thing will this Bible be? The
beginning of Genesis, (pp.&nbsp;207-253,) is to be rejected
because it "is not an authentic utterance of Divine
knowledge, but a human utterance, which it has
pleased Providence to use in a special way for the
education of mankind." (p.&nbsp;253.) We are invited to
"a frank recognition of the <i>erroneous views of Nature</i>
which the Bible contains." (p.&nbsp;211.) Thus, <i>all</i> miraculous
transactions will have to be explained away.
The volume of Prophecy will have to be regarded as
a volume of History. The very History will have to
be read with distrust. Like other records, it is subject
to the conditions of "knowledge which existed in
an early stage of the world." (p.&nbsp;411.) It does not
even begin to be authentic, until <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1900; or rather,
until <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 900<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. What remains is to be looked upon
as "the continuous witness in all ages of the higher
things in the heart of man," (p.&nbsp;375,)&mdash;(whatever
that may happen to mean.) The Gospel is to be
looked upon as "a life of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in the soul, instead
of a theory of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> which is in a book, or written
down," (p.&nbsp;423.) "The lessons of Scripture, when
disengaged from theological formulas, have a nearer
way to the hearts of the poor." (p.&nbsp;424.) Even "in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxiv" id="Page_ccxxiv">[ccxxiv]</a></span>Missions to the heathen, Scripture is to be treated as
the expression of universal truths, rather than of the
tenets of particular men and Churches." (p.&nbsp;423.) It
is anticipated that this "would remove many obstacles
to the reception of Christianity." (<i>Ibid.</i>) "It
is not the Book of Scripture which we should seek to
give the heathen;" "but the truth of the Book; the
mind of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and His Apostles, in which all lesser
details and differences should be lost and absorbed;"
"the purer light or element of Religion, of which
Christianity is the expression." (p.&nbsp;427.) ... Such is
the ghostly phantom, by the aid of which the Heathen
are to become evangelized!</p>

<p>But this historical Bible is not to be regarded as
the rule of a man's life, or indeed as an external Law
at all. (pp.&nbsp;36, 45.) "We walk now by Reason and
Conscience <i>alone</i>." (p.&nbsp;21.) The Bible is to be identified
"with the voice of Conscience," (p.&nbsp;45,)&mdash;which
it has "to evoke, not to override." (p.&nbsp;44.) "The principle
of private judgment ... makes Conscience the
supreme interpreter." (p.&nbsp;45.) Ours is "a law which
is <i>not imposed upon us by another power</i>, but <i>by our own
enlightened will</i>:" (p.&nbsp;35:) for the "Spirit, or Conscience"
"legislates" henceforth "<i>without appeal except
to himself</i>." (p.&nbsp;31.)</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of "Traditional Christianity,"
(p.&nbsp;156,) it is not obscurely hinted that
something quite different is to be substituted in its
place. And first, next to "a frank appeal to Reason,
and a frank criticism of Scripture," (p.&nbsp;174,) the
nature and "office of the Church is to be properly
understood." (p.&nbsp;194.)</p>

<p>The Church then is a spontaneous development of
the State, as "part of its own organization," (p.&nbsp;195,)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxv" id="Page_ccxxv">[ccxxv]</a></span>&mdash;a
purely secular Institution. The State will "develop
itself into a Church" by "throwing its elements,
or the best of them, into another mould; and constituting
out of them a Society, which is in it, though
in some sense not of it (?),&mdash;which is another (?), yet
the same." (p.&nbsp;194.) The nation must provide, from
time to time, that the teaching of one age does "not
traditionally harden, so as to become an exclusive
barrier in a subsequent one; and so the moral growth
of those who are committed to the hands of the
Church be checked." (<i>Ibid.</i>) The Church is founded,
therefore, not upon "the possession of a supernaturally
communicated speculation&nbsp;(!) concerning <span class="smcap">God</span>," but
"upon <i>the manifestation of a Divine Life in Man</i>."
"Speculative doctrines should be left to <i>philosophical
schools</i>. A national Church must be concerned with
the <i>ethical development</i> of its members." (p.&nbsp;195.) It
should be "free from dogmatic tests, and similar intellectual
bondage;" (p.&nbsp;168;) hampered by no Doctrines,
pledged to no Creeds. These may be retained
indeed; but "<i>we refuse to be bound by them</i>." (p.&nbsp;44.)
The Subscription of the Clergy to the Articles should
also be abolished: for "no promise can reach fluctuations
of opinion, and personal conviction."&nbsp;(!!!)
<i>Open</i> heretical teaching may, to be sure, be dealt
with by the Law; but the Law "should not require
any act which appears to signify 'I think.'" (p.&nbsp;189.)
Witness "the reluctance of the stronger minds to
enter an Order in which their intellects may not have
<i>free play</i>." (p.&nbsp;190.) ... Such then is the Negative Religion!
Such is the new faith which Doctors Temple
and Williams, Professors Powell and Jowett, Messieurs
Wilson, Goodwin, and Pattison, have deliberately
combined to offer to the acceptance of the World!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxvi" id="Page_ccxxvi">[ccxxvi]</a></span>
It is high time to conclude. I cannot lay down
my pen however until I have re-echoed the sentiments
of one with whom I heartily agree. I allude to Dr.
Moberly; who professes that he is "struck almost
more with what seems to him the hardheartedness,
and exceeding unkindness of this book, than with its
unsoundness. Have the writers," (he asks,) "considered
how far the suggesting of innumerable doubts,&mdash;doubts
unargued and unproved,&mdash;will check honest
devotion, and embolden timid sin? <i>For whom</i> do they
intend this book? Is it written for the mass of
general readers? Is it designed for students at the
Universities? Do they suppose that this multitude
of random suggestions will be carefully wrought out
by these readers, and be rejected if unsound; so as to
leave their faith and devotion untarnished?... Have
they reflected how many souls for whom <span class="smcap">Christ</span> died
may be slain in their weakness by <i>their</i> self-styled
strength?"</p>

<p>"Suppose, for a moment, that the Holy Scriptures
<i>are</i> (p.&nbsp;177,) the Word of the Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;that
the Miracles, (cf. p.&nbsp;109,) including the Resurrection
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, are actual objective facts, which have really
happened,&mdash;that the Doctrines of the Church are true,
(p.&nbsp;195,) and the Creeds (p.&nbsp;355,) the authoritative
expositions of them,&mdash;and that men are to reach Salvation
through faith in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, Virgin-born, according
to the Scriptures, and making atonement (cf. p.&nbsp;87,)
for their sins upon the Cross. <span class="smcap">On this supposition</span>,&mdash;<i>Is
not the publication of this book an act of real hostility
to <span class="smcap">God's</span> Truth; and one which endangers the Faith
and Salvation of Men?</i> And is this hostility less real,
or the danger diminished, because the writers are, all
but one, Clergymen, some of them Tutors and School<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxvii" id="Page_ccxxvii">[ccxxvii]</a></span>masters;
because they wear the dress, and use the
language of friends, and threaten us with bitter opposition
if we do not regard them as such<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With this I lay down my pen. My last words
shall be simple and affectionate, addressed solely to
yourselves.</p>

<p>I trace these concluding lines,&mdash;(of a work which,
but for <i>you</i>, would never have been undertaken,)&mdash;in
a <i>quite</i> empty College; and in the room where we
have so often and so happily met on Sunday evenings.
Can you wonder if, at the conclusion of what has
proved rather a heavy task, (so <i>hateful</i> to me is controversy,)
my thoughts revert with affectionate solicitude
to yourselves, already scattered in all directions;
and to those evenings which more, I think,
than any other thing, have gilded my College life?...
In thus sending you a written farewell, and praying
from my soul that <span class="smcap">God</span> may bless and keep you
all, I cannot suppress the earnest entreaty that you
would remember the best words of counsel which may
have at any time fallen from my lips: that you would
persevere in the daily study of the pure Book of Life;
and that you would read it, <i>not</i> as feeling yourselves
called upon to sit in judgment on its adorable contents;
but rather, as men who are permitted to draw
near; and invited <i>to listen</i>, and <i>to learn</i>, and <i>to live</i>.
And so farewell!... "Watch ye, stand fast in the
Faith,"&mdash;nay, take it in the original, which is far
better:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ccxxviii" id="Page_ccxxviii">[ccxxviii]</a></span>&mdash;&#915;&#961;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;, &#963;&#964;&#8053;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;, &#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#949;. &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#8049;&#960;&#8131; &#947;&#953;&#957;&#8051;&#963;&#952;&#969;.

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> I abstain from enumerating Dr. Temple's mistakes,&mdash;for such
things do not belong to the essence of a composition. And yet
I must remark that it is hardly creditable in a Doctor of Divinity
to write as he does. "In <i>all</i>&nbsp;(!) the doctrinal disputes of the fourth
and fifth centuries, the decisive voice came from Rome. Every
controversy was finally settled by her opinion, because she alone
possessed <i>the art of framing formulas</i>," &amp;c. (p.&nbsp;16.) Would the
learned writer favour us with <i>a single warrant</i> for this assertion?...
At p.&nbsp;9, Dr. Temple mistakes for Micah's, words spoken 700
years before by Balaam. At p.&nbsp;10, he says that "Prayer, as
a regular and necessary part of worship, first appears in the later
books of the Old Testament."&mdash;His account of the papacy is contained
in the following words:&mdash;"Law was the lesson which Rome
was intended to teach the world. Hence (?) the Bishop of Rome
soon became the Head of the Church. Rome was in fact the centre
of the traditions which had once governed the world; and their
spirit still remained; and the Roman Church developed into the
papacy simply because a head was wanted&nbsp;(!), and no better one
could be found."&mdash;p.&nbsp;16. At p.&nbsp;10 we have a truly puerile misconception
of the meaning of 1 Cor. xv. 56, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></div>

be imposed upon the Clergy by reason of their subscription to the
Thirty-nine Articles. Yet it is more difficult than might be expected,
to define what is the extent of the legal obligation of those
who sign them; and in this case, the strictly legal obligation is the
measure of the moral one. Subscription may be thought even to
be <i>inoperative upon the conscience</i> by reason of its vagueness. For
the act of subscription is enjoined, but its effect or meaning nowhere
plainly laid down; and it does not seem to amount to more than an
acceptance of the Articles of the Church as the formal law to which
the subscriber is <i>in some sense</i> subject. What that subjection
amounts to, must be gathered elsewhere; for it does not appear on
the face of the subscription itself."&mdash;(p.&nbsp;181. See down to page 185.)

the Light which shone upon the earth during the first three days
proceeded from the Sun, (the orb of which remained invisible,) and
not from any extraneous independent source,&mdash;I have no objection
whatever to such a supposition,&mdash;or indeed to any other which suffers
the inspired record to remain intact. I am by no means clear however
that Philosophy (begging her pardon,) does not entirely mistake
her office, when she pretends to explain the first chapter of Genesis.
Hence, her constrained language, and unnatural manner, when she
desires to be respectful,&mdash;her inconsequential remarks and perpetual
blunders when she rather prefers to be irreligious. She is simply
out of her element, and is discoursing of what <i>she does not understand</i>.&mdash;Theology,
dealing with a physical problem by the method
of Theological Science; and Philosophy, applying to a chapter in
the Bible the physical method,&mdash;are alike at fault, and alike ridiculous.
This truth, however obvious, does not seem to be generally
understood.
</p><p>
But, (to return to the first three days of Creation,)&mdash;since the
Author of Revelation seems to design that I should understand that
Sun, Moon, and Stars not only did not come to view until the fourth
day,&mdash;but also that they were not re-invested with their immemorial
function and office until then,&mdash;I find no difficulty, <i>remembering
with whom I have to do, even with Him who sowed the vault
of Heaven so thick with stars, each one of which may be not a sun
but a system</i><a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>;&mdash;when, I say, I attend to the emphatic nature of the
inspired record, on the one hand, and to <span class="smcap">God's</span> Omnipotence on the
other,&mdash;I have no difficulty in supposing that He embraced the Sun
in a veil, for just so long a period as it seemed Him good, and when
He willed that it should re-appear, that He withdrew the veil again.
The <i>name</i> for the operation just now alluded to belongs to the province
of Philosophy. Divinity is all the while thinking about something
infinitely better and higher.</p></div>

so strikingly expounded:&mdash;"Heaven, <i>the Heaven of Heavens, with

"the sea, with all that is therein." (Neh. ix. 6.) Whereas

</p><p>
"We are asked to believe that a vision of creation was presented
to him (Moses) by Divine power, for the purpose of enabling him to
inform the world of what he had seen; which vision inevitably led
him to give a description which has misled the world for centuries,
and in which the truth can now only with difficulty be recognized."
(p.&nbsp;247.) "The theories [of Hugh Miller and of Dr. Buckland] assume
that appearances only, not facts, are described; and that, in
riddles which would never have been suspected to be such, had we
not arrived at the truth from other sources." (p.&nbsp;249.) "For ages,
this simple view of Creation satisfied the wants of man, and formed
a sufficient basis of theological teaching:" but "modern research
now shews it to be physically untenable." (p.&nbsp;253.)
</p><p>
"The writer asserts solemnly and unhesitatingly that for which
he must have known that he had no authority." But this was only
because "the early speculator was harassed by no such scruples"
as "arise from our modern habits of thought, and from the modesty
of assertion&nbsp;(!) which the spirit of true science has taught us."
He therefore "asserted as facts what he knew in reality only as
probabilities.... He had seized one great truth.... With regard
to details, observation failed him."&mdash;(pp.&nbsp;252-3.)</p></div>

states that "a majority of the Clergy throughout the world,"&mdash;(with
whom he associates the "instincts of many laymen, perhaps also
individual interest,")&mdash;are in favour of "<i>withholding the Truth</i>."
But, he adds, (with the indignant emphasis of Virtue when she is reproaching
Vice,)&mdash;"a higher expediency pleads that 'honesty is the
best policy,' and that truth alone 'makes free!'"&mdash;How would such
insolence be treated in the common intercourse of daily life?&mdash;(I
will not pause to remark on Mr. Jowett's wanton abuse of the Divine
saying recorded in St. John viii. 32,&mdash;repeated at p.&nbsp;351.)</p></div>

the mere words of Scripture</i> have the same office with those
of all language written or spoken in sincerity." They must be
studied "by the same means and the same rules which would guide
us to the meaning of any other work; by a knowledge of the languages
in which the books were written, the Hebrew, the Chaldee,
the Greek, and of those other languages, as the Syriac and Arabic,
which may illustrate them; and of all the ordinary rules of Grammar
and Criticism, and the peculiar information respecting times
and circumstances, history and customs,&mdash;all the resources, in a
word, of the Interpretation of any work of any kind. <i>The Grammatical
and Historical interpretation of profane or sacred writings
is the same</i>.... "All Scripture," meanwhile, "<i>is given by Inspiration
of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>:" and this at once introduces several important
differences; which whoever neglects may yet, with whatsoever advantages
of learning and talent, fail to discover the real meaning of
the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>."&mdash;From Dr. Hawkins (Provost of Oriel)'s <i>Inaugural
Lecture</i> as Dean Ireland's Professor, delivered in 1847,&mdash;pp.

It is but fair to Mr. Jowett to add that, <i>in terms</i>, he has very
nearly (not quite) said the self-same thing himself, at p.&nbsp;337, (upper
half the page.) But it is the peculiar method of this most slippery
writer, or most illogical thinker, occasionally to grant almost all that
heart can desire, as far as <i>words</i> go; but straightway to deny, or
evacuate, or explain away, <i>the thing</i> which those words ought to
signify.&mdash;Thus, at p.&nbsp;337, he volunteers the remark that "No one
who has a Christian feeling would place Classical on a level with
Sacred Literature;" and at p.&nbsp;377, he observes that, "There are
many respects in which Scripture is unlike any other book." And
yet, (as I have shown, p. cxliii. to p. cl.,) Mr. Jowett <i>puts</i> the Bible
on a level with Sophocles and Plato; and argues throughout as if
Scripture were in <i>no</i> essential respect unlike any other book!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_224_224" id="Footnote_224_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_224_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> "Had this writer reminded us that the New Testament Greek
is a Greek of different age from that of the classical writers; had he
simply warned us that we must not press our Attic Greek scholarship
too far, but study the Alexandrian Greek of the Septuagint,
Philo, &amp;c. in order to ascertain the exact meaning of the words and
phrases of the writers of the New Testament;&mdash;still more, if, as the
result of such study on his own part, he had offered us some well-digested
observations on the use of tenses, articles, or particles in
the sacred writings;&mdash;he would have done some service. But this
talk about 'excessive attention to the article,' and 'particles being
often mere excrescences of style,' is of no effect except to expose the
writer to ridicule. It sounds as if he had been accustomed to lay
down the law to an admiring audience of 'clever young men,' and
had forgotten that there were still 'men in Denmark' who understood
Greek."&mdash;<i>Some Remarks on Essays and Reviews</i>, prefixed to

<p>THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE RECOMMENDED; AND
A METHOD OF STUDYING IT DESCRIBED.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">St. John</span> vi. 68.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:2em;"><i><span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of Eternal
Life.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It was probably in that synagogue which the faithful
Centurion built at Capernaum<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> that our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
had been discoursing. At the end of His discourse,
it is related that "many of His Disciples went back,
and walked no more with Him." Thereupon, He
asked the Twelve, "Will ye also go away?" the very
form of His inquiry (&#924;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;) implying the answer
which the Divine Speaker expected and desired.
And to this challenge of Love to Faith, St. Peter
replied, not only on behalf of his fellow-Apostles, but
on behalf of all faithful men to the end of time:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
to <i>whom</i> shall we go? <i>Thou</i> hast the words
of Eternal Life!"</p>

<p>You perceive that St. Peter's confession takes a peculiar
form,&mdash;resting the impossibility of unfaithfulness
in the Apostles on the gracious discourse of Him
to whom they had been listening. "A hard saying,"
and unpalatable, it had proved to many; but to his
own taste it had seemed "sweeter than honey and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>honeycomb." So that while, to those others, it had been
an occasion of going back, and walking with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
no more,&mdash;to himself it had been a reason why he
could never, as he felt, be persuaded to forsake <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.
Nay, it was to himself, (and, as he boldly assumed,
to his fellow-Apostles,) a sufficient evidence that the
Speaker was none other than the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>. "And
we believe, and are sure, that Thou art the <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of the living <span class="smcap">God</span>!"</p>

<p>Here then, surely, a very solemn picture is set
before us. The same message proves, in the case of
some, the savour of death unto death: in the case
of others, of life unto life. It is an image of what
is still taking place in the world. The Gospel, whether
veiled in the Old Testament, or unveiled in the
New, is confessedly "a hard saying:"&mdash;to some, their
very crown and joy; to others, only an occasion of
distress and downfall. It was so, when proclaimed
not by the tongue of men and of angels, but by the
lips "full of grace and truth" of the Incarnate <span class="smcap">Word</span>
Himself: and it is so still. The temper of mankind
is still the same as it was of old, and the instrument
of man's trial is still the same.</p>

<p>Of the written Gospel, many of the self-same things
are said in Scripture which are said of Him by whom
that Gospel was preached. Thus, it is proclaimed
to be "the power of <span class="smcap">God</span> to salvation<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>." It is described
as "a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>." It is declared to be eternal,&mdash;a thing
which "shall never pass away<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>." "In the last day,"
it is prophesied that the words which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> has
spoken "shall judge" men<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. The very Name by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>which St. John designates the Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span>, in the
forefront of his Gospel<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>, is the appellation by which
the Gospel is emphatically known.&mdash;But even more
remarkable are the analogies which subsist between
the written record of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Life and Teaching,
and the actual person of our <span class="smcap">Lord.</span> And proposing,
as I now do, to say a few earnest words to the younger
men in recommendation of a more punctual, methodical,
as well as attentive study of the Bible, than,
I am persuaded, is practised by one young man in
a thousand,&mdash;it may not prove unavailing in awakening
attention, if I advert, in passing, to some of the
circumstances whereby an even balance, (so to speak,)
is established between the opportunities of the men
of this generation, and of those who were blessed with
the oral teaching of the Son of Man.</p>

<p>1. Thus, if the record has its difficulties, and its
seeming contradictions, so had <i>He</i>. It did not appear
that "<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> <i>of Nazareth</i>" was born, (according to the
prophet Micah's prediction,) at <i>Bethlehem</i><a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. His title
perplexed even Nathanael<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.&mdash;He was called the son
of <i>Joseph</i>, even <i>by the Blessed Virgin<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></i>. How then
could He be the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>? And how was the
famous prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled in Him<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>?&mdash;He
grew up in a lowly estate. Once He is called "the
carpenter<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>." How then could He be of the Royal
House of David? And so, in many other respects,
did He, in His own person, present the self-same class
of difficulties to the world's eye which His Gospel
presents to ours:&mdash;"the sixteenth of Tiberius,"&mdash;the
two genealogies,&mdash;"Cyrenius,"&mdash;"the days of Abiathar,"&mdash;"Jeremy
the prophet,"&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
2. Somewhat less obvious, but not less true, is the
unattractive aspect, at first sight, of the Gospel.
Verily there is, until we become intimately acquainted
with it, "no beauty that we should desire" it.&mdash;The
style, (full of interest, to those who have tried to
understand it a little,) is not, I suppose, what critics
would call altogether a good style.&mdash;The Greek is not
what learned men call <i>pure</i>.&mdash;Many a word, (brimfull
of meaning to those who will give to the words of the
Gospel their best care,) reminds one, that neither did
<i>He</i> speak what, in the capital of Jewry, was accounted
a classical idiom. He employed the accent of the
despised Galilee.&mdash;The very reasoning, (until you
give it your heart's homage and best attention,) often
seems to be either inconsequential, or to contain a fallacy.
Certain words of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have been even <i>cited</i>
as fallacious by a celebrated Divine whose writings
we are all familiar with<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. Now, <i>His</i> words were disregarded,
cavilled at, made light of, in just the same
manner.</p>

<p>3. Most surprising of all is the analogy observable
between the union of the Divine and the human
element in the Gospels,&mdash;and the strictly parallel
union, as it seems, of the two natures, the Divine
and the Human, in the person of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&mdash;As <i>He</i>
was perfect and faultless, so do we deem <i>it</i> infallible
also, without spot or blemish of any kind. We reject
as monstrous any 'theory of Inspiration,' (as it is
called,) which imputes blunders to the work of the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>.&mdash;As, further, we claim for our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
recorded human actions mysterious significancy, so do
we seem warranted in looking for a mysterious purpose,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>a divine meaning, in every expression of the
written Word.&mdash;Lastly, although we may, nay we
must, admit such a Divine and such a human element,
we must altogether deny the possibility of separating
the one from the other. We cannot separate Scripture
into human and Divine. Like the Incarnate <span class="smcap">Word</span>,
the Gospel is at once both human <i>and</i> Divine, yet one
and indivisible. And the method of its inspiration is
as great a difficulty in its way, and as much beyond
our ken, as the nature of the union of the Godhead
and the Manhood in the one person of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, and whether you please to
accept the foregoing remarks or not, it is a plain fact
that the Gospel is now in the world, fulfilling the
same office towards mankind, which our Saviour
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself fulfilled, and experiencing the same
treatment at the hands of men in return. It is leavening
society indeed, and remodelling the world, even
while it is practically overlooked by politicians or
experiencing evil treatment from them. It wins its
way silently and secretly, yet surely; and it works
miracles here and there. Moreover, it divides opinion;
separating, as it will for ever separate, the
light from the darkness<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>. It is slighted, and overlooked,
and neglected by some; even while, by others,
it is embraced with joy unspeakable. 'The humble
and meek' adore it; even while, by the proud and
rebellious, it is after a most strange fashion cavilled
at, called in question, and denied. We specify <i>the
Gospel</i>, instinctively, as that part of the Inspired
Word which chiefly concerns ourselves, as Christian
men; but the entire deposit shares the same fate.
I do not think I am delivering a paradox when I say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>that the Bible is generally very little read. That the
amount of <i>study</i> commonly bestowed upon it bears
no proportion whatever to its transcendent importance
and paramount value, shall not be any paradox at
all; but a mere truism.</p>

<p>For I entreat you to consider, (trite and obvious
as it may sound,) <i>What</i> have we, in the whole wide
world, which may be put in competition with that
Book which contains <span class="smcap">God's</span> revelation of Himself to
man? In its early portions, how does it go back to
the very birthday of Time, and discourse of things
which were done in the grey of that early morning!
How mysterious is the record,&mdash;so methodical, so particular,
so unique; preserving the very words which
were syllabled in Paradise, and describing transactions
which no one but the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> is competent to
declare! Come lower down, and <i>where</i> will you find
more beautiful narratives,&mdash;still fresh at the end
of three and four thousand years,&mdash;than those stories
of Patriarchs, Judges, Kings, which wrap up divinest
teaching in all their ordinary details: where every
word is weighed in a heavenly balance, fraught with
a divine purpose, and intended for some glorious
issue: where the very characters are adumbrations
of personages far greater than themselves; and where
the course of events is made to preach to us, at this
distant day, of the things which concern our peace!
Is it a light thing again to know in what terms
Isaiah, and the rest of "the goodly fellowship," when
they opened their lips to speak in that remote age,
foretold of the coming of the Son of Man?... But all
seems to grow pale before the Everlasting Gospel, and
the other writings of the New Testament. Surely we
have become too familiar with the providence which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>has preserved to us the very words of the four Evangelists,
if we can bend our thoughts in the direction
of the Gospel without a throb of joy and wonder not
to be described, at having so great a treasure placed
within our easy reach. Can it indeed be, that I may
listen while the disciple whom <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> loved is discoursing
of the miracles, and recalling the sayings of
his <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? May I hear St. Peter himself address the
early Church,&mdash;or know the precise words of the
message which St. Jude sent to the first believers,&mdash;or
be shown the Epistle which the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> cousin
addressed "to the Twelve Tribes scattered abroad"?
How does it happen that the Book is not for ever
in our hands which comes to us with such claims to
our undivided homage?</p>

<p>But, on the contrary, it has become the fashion in
certain quarters, on every imaginable pretext, to call
in question the credibility of the Bible. It seems to
be the taste of the age to invent hazy difficulties and
dim objections to its statements. Inspiration, under
a miserable attempt to explain it, is openly explained
away. And the theory, however crude and preposterous,
is tolerated: at least it escapes castigation.
It cannot fail but that the unlearned and thoughtless
ones of this generation will be growing up in a notion
that these are open questions after all, and that
"Truth" is but a name,&mdash;not a thing worth contending,
aye <i>dying</i> for, if need be! The reason is but too
obvious. It must be, partly, because we do not in
reality prize the deposit nearly so much as we suppose.
Partly, because of the indifferentism which is
everywhere so prevalent. Partly too because, notwithstanding
our intellectual activity, we are not
a really learned body. And partly, it must be con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>fessed,
the reason is, because Theology has become so
nearly a prostrate study with us, and because men
really able to do battle for the Truth are somewhat
hard to find. Nor is there any reasonable prospect
of improvement either; for those who go forth from
this place into the Ministry, go with such slender
preparation, that it would be truer to say that they
go with none at all.</p>

<p>Now, it would be a mere waste of time, to inveigh
for half an hour against the indifferentism, or the
spurious liberality, of the age: and it would be a
most unbecoming proceeding, (not to say a highly
distasteful one,) from this place to be suggesting
remedies for an evil which already lies very near the
heart of every serious man among us; and which,
if discussed at all, must be discussed elsewhere. To
say the truth, while the neglect of Theology, and the
low ebb of Theological attainments in our Clergy,
is generally recognized, the remedy for the evil is by
no means so clear. From this subject, then, I pass
at once: and I shall content myself with the far
humbler task, of urging upon the younger men present,&mdash;those
especially who are destined for the Ministry,&mdash;one
act of preparation, one duty, about which,
at all events, there cannot be any difference of opinion:
I mean the duty of applying themselves, <i>now</i>, to the
patient study of the Bible.</p>

<p>The thing is soon said; but the hint requires expanding
a little, in order that it may become of any
practical use.&mdash;By the "study of the Bible," I do not
mean a chapter occasionally read with care: nor even
a chapter regularly conned over at night; when a
convivial meeting has blunted the edge of observation,
or severe study has exhausted the powers of the brain.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>The <i>devotional</i> use of a portion of Holy Scripture is
quite a distinct affair. Still less would the practice
satisfy me of following the lessons in the College
Chapel: and this for reasons so obvious that I will
not stop to point them out. Nor even is the reading
of the Bible in College Lecture, the thing I mean;
for reasons also which any acute person will readily
ascertain for himself. None of these methods of acquainting
yourselves with the contents of the Bible
come up to the thing I contemplate, although each
is good in its way; and of course I am not speaking
in disparagement of any.</p>

<p>No. The thing I would so strenuously urge upon
you, is,&mdash;that, during your undergraduate period,
you should read the whole Bible consecutively through,
from one end to the other, <i>by</i> yourself and <i>for</i> yourself,
with consummate method, care, and attention.
The fundamental conditions of such a study of the
Bible, in order to make it of any real use, are
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. First, that you should deliberately apportion to
this solemn duty the best and freshest and quietest
half-hour in the whole day; and then, that you should
determine, let what will go undone, never to abridge
<i>that</i> half-hour. You may sometimes be enabled to
afford a little <i>more</i> time to the chapter: but you will
find it quite fatal ever to devote a shorter period
to it. And half an hour, if you employ it in right
good earnest, at present, must be thought enough.</p>

<p>2. Next, (except on Sundays and in Vacation,
when you may safely double your daily task and your
daily time,) be persuaded to read each day exactly one
chapter. On no account attempt to go reading on;
but rather spend the moments which remain over,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>(they <i>cannot</i> be many!) in reviewing that day's portion;
or referring to some of the places indicated in
the margin; or glancing over yesterday's chapter.</p>

<p>The effect of building up your Bible knowledge in
this manner, bit by bit, is what you would not anticipate.
The whole acquires a solidity and compactness
not to be attained by any other method. You
will find at the end of many days, not only that the
structure has attained to symmetry and beauty,&mdash;but
that the disposition of its several parts, in some respects,
has become intelligible also: while, (what is
not of least importance,) the foundation on which all
the superstructure rests, proves wondrous secure and
strong.</p>

<p>3. Then, while you read,&mdash;safe from the risk of
interruption, (as I began by supposing,) and with
every faculty intent on your task,&mdash;try, as much as
possible, to go over the words as if they were new to
you; and watch them, one by one, so that nothing
may by any possibility escape your notice. Do not
slumber over a single word. Nothing can be unimportant
when it is the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> who speaketh.
It is an excellent practice to mark the expressions
which strike you; for it is a method of preserving the
memory of what is sure else soon to pass away.</p>

<p>4. And next, be persuaded to read without extraneous
helps of any kind; except, of course, such
help as a map, or the margin of your Bible, supplies.
Pray avoid Commentaries and notes. First, you cannot
afford time for them: and secondly, if you could,
they would be as likely to mislead you as not. But
the real reason why you are so strenuously advised to
avoid them, is, because they will do more to nullify
your reading, than anything which could be imagined.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Your object is to obtain an insight into Holy Scripture,
by acquiring the habit of reading it with intelligence
and care: <i>not</i> to be saved trouble, and to be
shown what <i>other persons</i> have thought about it.</p>

<p>5. But then, though you are entreated not to have
recourse to the notes of others, you are as strongly
advised to make brief memoranda of your own: and
the briefer the better. Construct <i>your own</i> table of
the Patriarchs,&mdash;<i>your own</i> analysis of the Law,&mdash;<i>your
own</i> descent of the Kings,&mdash;<i>your own</i> enumeration of
the Miracles. A pedigree full of faults, made by
yourself, will do you more good than the most accurate
table drawn up by another: but if you are at all
attentive and clever, <i>it will not be</i> full of faults.&mdash;<i>You</i>
will perhaps make the parables 56 instead of 30: you
will have gained 26 by your honest industry. Nay,
keep a record of your difficulties, if you please; or of
anything which strikes you, and which you would be
sorry to forget. But, as a rule, it is well to write
little, and to give your time and thought to the record
before you.</p>

<p>6. Above all, is it indispensable that your reading
of the Bible should be strictly consecutive; and on no
account may any one pretend to begin such a study of
that book as I am here recommending, except at <i>the
first Chapter of Genesis</i>. It is a great mistake, (though
one of the commonest of all,) for a man to imagine that
he knows the beginning of the Bible pretty well. I
say it advisedly, that it would be easy to write down
twelve interesting questions on that first chapter, of
which none of the younger men present would be able
to answer three,&mdash;and yet, they should all be questions
of such a sort that a labouring man's child with an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>open Bible would be able infallibly to answer them
every one.</p>

<p>7. It will follow from what has been offered, that
you are invited to read every book in the Bible in the
order in which it actually stands,&mdash;never, of course,
skipping a chapter; much less a Book. In every mere
catalogue of names, be resolved to find edification.
Feel persuaded that details, seemingly the driest, are
full of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Remember that the difference between
every syllable of Scripture and all other books in the
world is, not a difference of <i>degree</i>, but of <i>kind</i>. All
books but one, are <i>human</i>: that one book is <i>Divine</i>!</p>

<p>Now, you will perceive that the kind of study of
the Bible here recommended, is somewhat different
from what is commonly pursued. I contemplate the
continued exercise of a most curious and prying, as
well as a most vigilant and observing eye. <i>No</i> difficulty
is to be neglected; <i>no</i> peculiarity of expression
is to be disregarded; <i>no</i> minute detail is to be overlooked.
The hint let fall in an earlier chapter is to be
compared with a hint let fall in the later place. Do
they tally or not? and what follows? The chronological
details spontaneously evolved by the narrative,
are to be unerringly discovered by the student <i>for
himself</i>. The course of every journey is to be attentively
noted. Things omitted are to be spied out as
carefully as things set down; and whatever can possibly
be gathered in the way of necessary inference, is
to be industriously ascertained. The imagination is
not to slumber either, because no pains are taken by
the sacred writer to move the feelings or melt the
heart.</p>

<p>How <i>soon</i> will any one who takes the trouble to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>read the Bible after this fashion, be struck with a
hundred things which he never knew before,&mdash;indeed,
which are not commonly known! How will he be for
ever eliciting unsuspected facts,&mdash;detecting undreamed
of coincidences, but which are as important as they are
true,&mdash;accumulating materials of value quite inestimable
for future study in Divine things! However
unpromising a certain collection of references may be,
he is careful to extend it,&mdash;convinced, like a wise
householder, that there will come an use for it after
many days. His whole aim is to <i>master thoroughly</i> the
record which he has undertaken to study.</p>

<p>Let me not be misunderstood if it is added that
the Bible should be read,&mdash;I do not say <i>in the same
manner</i>,&mdash;that is, in the same temper and spirit,&mdash;but
at least <i>with the same attention</i>, as is bestowed upon
a merely human work. In truth, it should be read
with much more attention. But <i>that</i> diligence which
a student commonly bestows on a difficult moral
treatise, or an obscure drama, or a perplexed history,&mdash;analyzing
it, comparing passage with passage, and
learning a great deal of it by heart,&mdash;I am quite at
a loss to understand why a student of the Bible should
be a stranger to.&mdash;"I do much condemn," (says Lord
Bacon), "I do much condemn that Interpretation of
the Scripture which is only after the manner as men
use to interpret a profane book." So do I. Scripture
is to be approached and handled in quite a different
spirit from a common history. The mind, the heart
rather, must bow down before its revelations, in the
most suppliant fashion imaginable. The book should
ever be approached with prayer:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, open Thou
mine eyes that I may see the wondrous things of Thy
Law!" The very printed pages should be handled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>with reverence, in consideration of the message they
contain. But what I am saying is, that none of the
methods which diligence and zeal have ever invented
to secure a complete mastery of the contents of any
merely <i>human</i> performance, may be overlooked by
a student of <i>the Bible</i>.</p>

<p>To what has gone before I will add one caution, and
will trouble you with one only. It would be easy to
multiply cautions: but I am talking to highly intelligent
men; and there is only one rock which I am
really fearful of your running against.</p>

<p>It was the advice of a great and good man, (to his
clergy, I suspect,) that they should read the Bible
<i>with a special object</i>: and an excellent recent writer
has repeated the same advice; namely that men should
"read with a view to some particular inquiry, with
purpose to clear up some peculiar question of interest,
which," (says he,) "you may create for yourselves<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>."
I entreat <i>you</i> to do nothing of the kind. Whatever
advantages may result to an advanced student from
adopting this practice, to <i>you</i> it <i>must</i> be fraught with
unmingled evil. You will be tempted to overrate the
importance of everything you discover which suits
your present purpose: you will disregard all that looks
in a different direction: you will be disappointed if
you meet with nothing <i>ad rem</i>: you will get a habit
of slurring over many chapters, many whole books of
the Bible. A very little reflection will convince you
that it must be as I say. <i>Who</i>, for example, could be
expected to find delight and edification in the calendar
of the Deluge, who had determined to read Genesis
with a view to discovering what knowledge existed in
the patriarchal age of a future life? No. Your wisdom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>will be to divest your minds, as much as possible, of
<i>any</i> preconceived notion as to what the Bible contains,
or was intended to teach you. You should wish to
find there nothing so much as the authentic evidence
of <i>what</i> Divine Wisdom hath seen fit to communicate
to man. Read it therefore, if you are wise, with unaffected
curiosity: settling down upon every flower,
in order to find out, if you can, <i>where</i> the honey <i>is</i>:
clinging to it rather, <i>until you have found</i> the honey.
Say to yourself,&mdash;"It cannot be that all these details
of months and days should be given in vain<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. I <i>must</i>
find out the reason of it." And, at last, you will find,&mdash;what
you will find.&mdash;"Very strange," (you will learn
to say to yourself,) "that the history of nearly 1600
years should be curdled into one short chapter<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>; and
yet that three verses of the Bible should be devoted to
the history of a man's losing his way in a field, and
then finding it again<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>!" The subject may be worth
thinking about. You are perhaps naturally disposed
to take what you are pleased to call "a common sense
view" of the meaning of Holy Scripture; and to interpret
it after a very dry unlovely fashion of your own:
to evacuate its deeper sayings, and to doubt the mysterious
significancy of its historical details. You will
speedily perceive, however, that the Apostles and
Evangelists of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;as many as were moved by
the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and spoke not their own
words but <i>His</i>,&mdash;that all these are against you: and
the effect of this discovery on an honest and good
heart, reading not in order to be confirmed in some
preconceived opinion, but with a sincere desire of enlightenment
in Divine things,&mdash;may be anticipated.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Bishop Horsley relates that by a yet simpler process
he became disabused of a favourite fancy with which
he set out,&mdash;namely, that prophecy must of necessity
carry a single meaning<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.&mdash;The attitude of mind which
I so strongly recommend you to assume, (and it depends
on an act of the Will, whether you assume it
or not,) is very exactly represented by the cry of
the child Samuel,&mdash;"Speak <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, for Thy servant
heareth!"</p>

<p>It seems right, in the fewest words, to state what
we <i>do</i>,&mdash;and what we do <i>not</i>,&mdash;expect to result from
such a study of the Bible as this; in other words, to
assign the office of unassisted Biblical study. I would
not willingly have my meaning mistaken <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>It is not implied then, for a moment, that a man is
either at liberty, or able, to gather his own Religion
for himself out of the Bible. The very thought were
monstrous. But it is a widely different thing for one
of yourselves to read his Bible patiently, and humbly,
and laboriously, through,&mdash;without prejudice or theory,&mdash;unmolested
by critical notes, undistracted by human
comments, uninfluenced by party views:&mdash;all this,
I say, is a widely different thing from a man's inventing
his own system of Divinity. Members of
the Catholic Church,&mdash;born in a Christian country,&mdash;educated
amid the choicest influences for good,&mdash;<i>you</i>
are by no means so left to yourselves. <span class="smcap">The Book of
Common Prayer</span> is your sufficient safeguard. The
framework of the Faith,&mdash;the conditions under which
you may lawfully speculate about Divine mysteries,&mdash;are
all prescribed for you: and within those limits you
cannot well go wrong.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the outlines of <i>Moral Theology</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>(as it may be called), you are fully competent to detect
for yourselves. <span class="smcap">God's</span> strictness in punishing
sin, as in the case of Moses<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>;&mdash;the efficacy of repentance,
as in the case of Ahab<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>;&mdash;the sure answer to
prayer, (to <i>forgotten</i> prayer, it may be!) as in the case
of Zacharias<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>;&mdash;the seemingly roundabout methods of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> providence, (as in the case of Abraham,) yet
conducting inevitably to a blessed issue at the last;&mdash;the
rewards of obedience<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>;&mdash;the faithfulness of the
Divine promises;&mdash;the boundless wealth of the Divine
contrivance, which, on man's repentance, is able to
convert even a curse into a blessing, as in the case of
Levi<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>;&mdash;the peace and joy surely in reserve for those
who fear <span class="smcap">God</span>, as in the case of Joseph;&mdash;the extent
to which things seemingly trivial are noticed by the
Ancient of Days, as every page of the Bible shows;&mdash;these,
and a hundred points like these, not only a man
can gather for himself out of the Book of God's Law,
but no one else can do the work for him. He <i>must</i>
discover all such matters for himself.</p>

<p>And need I point out, for a minute, the immense
advantage with which a mind so stored with Divine
knowledge will approach the Ministry; and finally
take in hand the actual oversight of the flock? It is
really not to be expressed. The Bishop's examination
for Orders will become nothing but an agreeable exercise,
instead of an object of dread. You are quite
sure of a few approving words in <i>that</i> quarter. But,
(what is a thousand times more important,) you yourself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>feel safe and strong. You begin to read some
treatise on Divinity; and you find yourself in some
degree competent to test the writer's statements, to
endorse or to suspect his conclusions, because you are
familiar with the Rule of Faith which he himself employed.
It becomes your turn at last to instruct
others,&mdash;from the pulpit for example; and instead of
timid truisms, and vague generalities, you are able to
draw a bold clear outline round almost any department
of Christian doctrine. You can explain with
authority.&mdash;You are not afraid to catechize before the
congregation: for although your Theological attainments
are but slender after all, yet, you know your
Bible well; and even if an absurdly wrong answer is
given you, you know how to single out from the hank
the golden thread of Truth, and to display it before
the eyes of men and Angels. And let me tell you,
by way of ending the subject, we should hear less
about dull sermons, and inattentive congregations,
and badly filled churches,&mdash;as well as about the
astounding ignorance of many among the upper
classes, in Divine things,&mdash;if our younger Clergy
knew the Bible a great deal better than they do.&mdash;Aye,
and we should not have so many unsound remarks
about Holy Scripture either,&mdash;so many mistaken
views of doctrine,&mdash;so many crude remarks
about Inspiration,&mdash;made <i>by persons who ought to
know better</i>.</p>

<p>You will perceive that I am saying all this, (except
the last few words,) <i>at</i> you, (the younger men
present;) because in <i>you</i> I see many of the future
Clergy of England. And I say it, because, (for the
last time,) I do entreat you, one and all, to follow the
advice I have been giving you; and to set about such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>a careful study of the Bible, <i>at once</i>. Do not put it
off for a single day. Begin it tomorrow morning.
You will then have mastered Genesis this term, finishing
the last chapter on Sunday the 10th of December;
and on Monday, the 11th, you will have to read the
first chapter of Exodus. I am confident that you will
remember <i>this</i> day and hour with gratitude to the end
of your lives, if you will but make the experiment
and persevere.</p>

<p>And just one word to those who aspire, (and all
<i>should</i> aspire,) to University honours. You will not
find what I have been recommending any hindrance
to you at all. But even supposing you <i>do</i>, now and
then, find the inexorable daily half-hour stand in the
way of something else,&mdash;shall not the very thought of
Him whose Voice you have deliberately resolved to
hear daily at that fixed time, make you full amends?
Shall you resolve to pluck so freely of the Tree of
Knowledge, and yet begrudge the approach once a day
to the <i>Tree of Life</i>, which grows in the midst of the
Paradise of <span class="smcap">God</span>? Shall ample time be found for
works of fiction,&mdash;for the Review, and the Magazine,
and the newspaper,&mdash;yet half an hour a day be deemed
too much to be given to the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>? What?
room for everything and everybody; yet still "no
room in the Inn" for <i><span class="smcap">Christ</span></i>!... I have, (I speak
honestly,) I have far too high an opinion of your instincts
for good, to think it possible. You have
plenty of faults,&mdash;(<i>God</i> knoweth!),&mdash;but I am very
much deceived indeed if there be not a spirit stirring
among the young men of this place, overflowing with
promise; a real inclination, (obscured at times, but
still very energetic,) for whatever things are pure,
and lovely, and of good report.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Of course, it is implied by what goes before, that
you will read <i>no</i> work <i>of Divinity</i> just at present. Be
counselled, on no account, to read any. Above all,
shun the partial, ill-digested pamphlet,&mdash;and the one-sided
review,&mdash;and the controversial letter,&mdash;and the
Essay which seems to have been written in order to
prove nothing. Be content, for the next three years,
to study no book of Divinity but the Bible.</p>

<p>And the study of <i>that</i> Book, I repeat, you will find
no hindrance, no impediment, no burthen to you at
all. On the contrary. It will render you a very
singular service,&mdash;let your classical and logical studies
be as severe as they will; (and they cannot well be too
severe, too engrossing,&mdash;for this is your golden opportunity
which never will, never <i>can</i>, come back again!)
The undersong of "Siloa's brook that flows, fast by
the oracle of <span class="smcap">God</span>," will many a time soothe and refresh
your else dry and weary spirit. What was begun as
a task will soon come to be regarded as a privilege.
<i>That</i> jealously-guarded half-hour will be found to be
the one green spot in the whole day,&mdash;like Gideon's
fleece, fresh with the dew of the early morning, when
it is "dry upon all the earth beside." Your secret
study of that Book of Books, I say, will render you
a very singular service. The contrast between the
Divine and Human method will strike you with ever-recurring
power. Unlike every other History, the
Bible removes the veil, and discovers the causes of
things,&mdash;including the First Great Cause of all, who
dwelleth in Light unapproachable, but who yet humbleth
Himself to behold, and to controul, and to overrule
for good, the things which are done in Heaven
and on Earth. And thus, it is not too much to say
that the Bible, to one who reads its pages aright, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>a certain clue to every other History,&mdash;as well as
a perpetual commentary on every other Book. It
informs the judgment, and cleanses the eye, throughout
the whole department of Morals: and as for History,
what is it all, but the evidence of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the
world,&mdash;"traces of <i>His</i> iron rod, or of <i>His</i> Shepherd's
staff<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>?"</p>

<p>Profoundly sensible am I, that these have been
very unintellectual, and somewhat common-place remarks:
but I would rather, a hundred times, be of
use to the younger men present; I would rather,
a hundred times, succeed in persuading one of <i>them</i>,
to adopt that method of reading the Bible which I
have been recommending;&mdash;than try to say something
which might be thought fine and clever....
Let me only, in conclusion, faithfully remind them,
that the <i>true</i> office of the study of Divine things is
not, by any means, that which, for obvious reasons,
I have been rather dwelling and enlarging upon. It
is <i>not</i> merely to inform the understanding, that Holy
Scripture is to be read with such consummate attention,
and studied with such exceeding care. It is
<i>not</i> for the illustration of History, or in order that it
may be made a test of the value of other systems of
Morals. <i>Not</i>, by any means, in order to facilitate
admission into Holy Orders, (for which only some of
you are destined;)&mdash;or to render a man's pulpit-addresses
attractive and agreeable;&mdash;or even to enable
a parish priest to teach with confidence and authority;&mdash;is
he entreated now to "prevent the night watches,"
if need be, that he may be occupied (like one of old
time<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>,) with <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word. O no! It is,&mdash;in order
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>that his inner life may be made conformable to that
outer Law<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>: that his aims may be ennobled, and his
motives purified, and his earthly hopes made consistent
with the winning of an imperishable crown! It is in
order that when he wavers between Right and Wrong,
the unutterable Canon of <span class="smcap">God's</span> <i>Law</i> may suggest itself
to him as a constraining motive. Its aim, and purpose,
and real function, is, that the fiery hour of temptation
may find the Christian soldier armed with "the sword
of the Spirit, which is the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>:"&mdash;that the
dark season of Adversity may find his soul anchored
on the Rock of Ages,&mdash;which alone can prove his
soul's sufficient strength and stay.... Of a truth, as
Life goes on, Men will find the blessedness of their
Hope; if they have not found it out already. Under
every form of trial,&mdash;and under every strange vicissitude;&mdash;in
sickness,&mdash;and in perplexity,&mdash;and in
bereavement,&mdash;and in the hour of death;&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;to
<i>whom</i> shall we go? Thou,&mdash;<i>Thou</i> hast the words
of Eternal Life!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hebrews</span> xi. 3.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:2em;"><i>Through Faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by
the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>St. Paul, in a famous and familiar chapter of his
Epistle to the Hebrews, having declared "what
Faith is," proceeds, (as the heading of the chapter
expresses it), to note "the worthy fruits thereof in
the Fathers of old time." The Book of Genesis was
obviously in his hands, or in his heart, while he
wrote: for he appeals to the transactions there recorded,
in the very order, and often in the very
words, of Moses. The <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, I say, directs
our attention to what is contained in the ivth,&mdash;vth,&mdash;vith,&mdash;xiith,&mdash;xviith,&mdash;xxiind,&mdash;xxviith,&mdash;xlviiith,&mdash;and
lth chapters of Genesis. But He begins with
a yet earlier chapter. <i>He begins with the first.</i> Abel,&mdash;Enoch,&mdash;Noah,&mdash;Abraham,&mdash;Sarah,&mdash;Isaac,&mdash;Jacob,&mdash;Joseph;&mdash;these
stand forward as samples of
God's faithful ones. But with them, the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>
proposes to associate <i>us</i>. Moreover, He gives <i>us</i> the
place of honour. Before mentioning one of <i>their</i> acts
of Faith, He mentions one of <i>ours</i>. We come first,&mdash;then
they. And the particular field in which <i>we</i>
shine out so conspicuously,&mdash;the special province
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>which is assigned to <i>us</i>,&mdash;that portion of the inspired
Narrative wherein <i>you and I</i> are supposed to shew
a degree of undoubting faith which entitles us to rank
with those "Fathers of old time,"&mdash;is found to be <i>the
first chapter of the Book of Genesis</i>. "Through Faith
<i>we</i> understand that the worlds were framed by the
Word of God." An honourable place, and an honourable
function truly! I would to <span class="smcap">God</span> that it might
be as gratifying to every one of the congregation, as
it is to the preacher, to discover that <i>this</i> is the
special stand-point which has been reserved for him
and for them.</p>

<p>Since, however, it is impossible to forget that we
have sometimes seen heads, which are supposed to be
very much indeed in advance of the age, shaken ominously
at the very chapter which the text bequeaths
and commends to the special acceptance of you and
me,&mdash;I propose that, in the very briefest manner, we
now review the contents of that chapter; in order
that we may discover what is the special absurdity,
or impossibility, or improbability, or by whatever
other name the thing is to be called,&mdash;which makes
it quite out of the question that you or I should
undertake the act of Faith here assigned us.</p>

<p>I read then, that "In the beginning, <span class="smcap">God</span> created
the Heaven and the Earth:"&mdash;by which I understand,
that, at some remote period,&mdash;which may or
may not baffle human Arithmetic<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>,&mdash;it was the pleasure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>of <span class="smcap">God</span> the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, <span class="smcap">God</span> the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, <span class="smcap">God</span> the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>,&mdash;<i>three</i> Persons, coeternal and coequal,&mdash;<i>one</i>
<span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;out of nothing, to create the entire Universe.
"All things that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth,
visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions,
or principalities, or powers: all things were
created by Him<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>;" and they were created out of nothing.
The word in the original does not indeed necessarily
imply as much: but since there is <i>no</i> word in
Hebrew, (any more than there is in Greek, Latin, or
English,) peculiarly expressive of the notion of creating
out of nothing, it need not excite our surprise that
Moses does not employ such a word to describe what
God did "in the beginning."&mdash;<i>Then</i> it was, in the
grey of that far distant morning I mean, that all those
glittering orbs which sow the vault of Heaven with
brightness and with beauty, flashed into sudden being.
"Thou, even Thou, art <span class="smcap">Lord</span> alone: Thou hast made
Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens, <i>with all their host<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></i>."
Suns, the centres of systems, many of them so distant
from this globe of ours, that sun and system scarce
shew so bright as a single lesser star: suns, I say,
with their marvellous equipage of attendant bodies,&mdash;<i>our</i>
sun among the rest, with all those wandering
fires which speed their unwearied courses round it:
suns, and planets with their moons, bathed once and
for ever in the fountain of that Light which <span class="smcap">God</span> inhabited
from all Eternity, then marshalled themselves
in mysterious order, according to "the counsel of His
will<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>:" yea, and with their furniture, unimagined
and unimaginable, went careering through the untrodden
realms of space, each on its several errand
of glory, because of obedience to its Maker's sovereign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Law<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. "By the Word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>," (as it is written,)
"were the Heavens made; and all the hosts of them
by the breath of His mouth<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>!"</p>

<p>Now, it is reserved to the geologist,&mdash;(Nature's
High-priest!)&mdash;to guess at the condition of this
Earth of ours throughout all the long period of unchronicled
ages which immediately succeeded the
birthday of Time. It is for <i>him</i> to guess at the successive
changes which this globe of ours underwent;
and the progressive cycles of Creation of which it
was the theatre; and the many strange races of creatures
which, one after another, moved upon its surface,&mdash;walking
the dry, or inhabiting the moist. <i>He</i>
shall guess; and <i>I</i> will sit at his feet and listen, with
unfeigned gratitude, wonder, and delight, while he
reports to me his guesses: (for the really great man
is eager to assure me that they are no more.)&mdash;But
when his tale of perplexity is ended, and the last 6,000
years of this world's History have to be discussed,
the geologist's function is at an end. I bid him, in
<span class="smcap">God's</span> Name, be silent; for now it is <span class="smcap">God</span> that speaketh.
If any question be moved as to how <i>that actual
system of things to which Man belongs</i>, began,&mdash;I bid
him come down, and take the learner's place; for now
<i>I</i> mean to assume his vacant chair. <i>This</i> time, there
shall at least be no guess-work. <span class="smcap">God</span> is now the
Speaker: and what <span class="smcap">God</span> revealeth unto <i>me</i>, <i>that</i> I
promise faithfully to report to <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>There was a time, then,&mdash;and it was certainly less
than 6,000 years ago,&mdash;when "the Earth was without
form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
deep." What catastrophe it was which had caused
that the fountains of the abyss should be broken up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>and the solid Earth submerged, I am not concerned to
explain:&mdash;nor how it had come to pass that from
a world of seas and continents, it had become a watery
ball, wrapped about with superincumbent vapour:&mdash;nor
how the blessed sunlight had suffered dire eclipse;&mdash;so
that the Earth revolved in a horror of great darkness.
<i>My faith</i> however is not troubled,&mdash;nor even
perplexed,&mdash;by the strangeness of these things. Shall
I think it a mere matter of course that one little flaw
in a pipe shall, in a second of time, transform the
orderly well-compacted seats of a goodly Church to
one unsightly mass of shapeless and disordered ruin<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>;
and shall I pretend to stand aghast at the strangeness
of a similar overthrow of this Earth's furniture at the
mere fiat of the Most High?... Behold, "He measureth
the waters in the hollow of His Hand, and
weigheth the mountains in scales<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>." What if the
Creator of the earth and the sea shall bid them of
a sudden change places? Think you that they would
hesitate to obey Him? Or what if He "calleth for
the waters of the Sea, and <i>poureth them out upon the
face of the Earth</i><a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>?"&mdash;Then further, if I believe, (as I
do believe,) that when the Jews crucified the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
Glory "there was darkness over all the land" from
the sixth hour unto the ninth<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>;&mdash;nay, that when
"Moses stretched forth his hand toward Heaven, there
was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt," even
darkness which might be felt, for three whole days<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>:&mdash;more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>than <i>that</i>; if I believe, (as I <i>do</i> believe,) the
solemn prediction of my <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that at the consummation
of all things, "The Sun shall be darkened, and
the Moon shall not give her light, and the Stars shall
fall from Heaven<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>:"&mdash;shall it move me to incredulity,
if God tells me, that six thousand years ago it was
His Divine pleasure that the same phenomenon should
prevail for a season? Surely,&mdash;(I say to myself,)&mdash;surely
this is He "which removeth the mountains,
and they know not: which shaketh the Earth out of
her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. <i>Which
commandeth the Sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
the Stars<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>!</i>"</p>

<p>1. But it was now <span class="smcap">God's</span> pleasure to bring Beauty
out of Chaos, and to establish a fresh order of things
upon the surface of our Earth. And, as the first
step thereto, "the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> moved upon the face
of the waters." The Hebrew phrase implies no less
than the tremulous brooding as of a bird,&mdash;causing
the dreary waste to heave and swell with coming life.
"And <span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let there be Light. And there was
Light." "He spake and it was done<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>." From Himself,
who is "the true Light," (not from the Sun, which,&mdash;like
the rest of the orbs of Heaven,&mdash;is but a lamp of
His kindling);&mdash;from Himself, I say, a ray of Light
went forth; and <i>that</i> is why He was pleased to praise
it. Look through the chapter, and you will find that
it is the only one of His creatures of which it is
specially said that "<span class="smcap">God</span> saw that it was good<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>." ... Thus,
one hemisphere was illumined,&mdash;whereby "<span class="smcap">God</span>
divided the light from the darkness;" and when the
Earth had completed a single revolution, there had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>been a Day and there had been a Night,&mdash;so named
by the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>: "and the evening and the
morning were the first Day<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>." ... Do you see any
impossibility so far? I, certainly, see none. It does
not seem to me absurd that "the Light of the world<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>,"
"dwelling in the light which no man can approach
unto<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>," should cause "the light to shine out of darkness<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>."
We shall perhaps come upon the absurdity by
and by. Let us hasten forward.</p>

<p>2. "And <span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let there be a firmament in
the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters." The Hebrew word (<i>an expansion</i>),
and the context, shew plainly enough what is meant.
The atmosphere was now created,&mdash;whereupon the
watery particles either subsided into sea, or rose aloft
in the form of clouds. "And the evening and the
morning were the second Day,"&mdash;which is the only day
of which it is not said that <span class="smcap">God</span> saw that it was good.</p>

<p>3. "And <span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let the waters under the
Heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let
the dry land appear." Then it was that these continents
were upheaved,&mdash;other than those which had
been continents before; and the sea sank into the
cavities which had been ordained for its reception.
<i>Then</i>, "<span class="smcap">God</span> saw that it was good." The sentence of
approval which had been withheld from the work of
yesterday, because that work, (namely, of dividing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>waters from the waters,) was incomplete,&mdash;is freely
bestowed to-day. And it may have been to teach us
that no incomplete work is "good," in <span class="smcap">God's</span> sight.&mdash;Next,
the Creator called into being every extant form
of vegetable life. So that, instead of a world of waters,
which was all that was to be seen yesterday,&mdash;not
only cliffs, and mountains, and bays,&mdash;but green hills,
and fertile valleys, and grassy meadows had come
to view,&mdash;with lakes, and rivers, and fountains, and
falls of water. Again it is written, concerning Earth's
green furniture, "<span class="smcap">God</span> saw that it was good." "And
the evening and the morning were the third Day."</p>

<p>4. "And <span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let there be Lights in the firmament
of the Heaven to divide the day from the night:
and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for
days, and for years." And so it was. Sun, moon,
and stars, came to view<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>; and this globe of ours, no
longer illumined, as, for three days, it had been, rejoiced
in the sun's genial light by day,&mdash;and by night
in the splendours of the paler planet. And thus was
also gained an easy measure for marking time,&mdash;the
succession of months and years, as well as of days.
"And <span class="smcap">God</span> saw that it was good." "And the evening
and the morning were the fourth Day."</p>

<p>5. "And <span class="smcap">God</span> said, Let the waters bring forth
abundantly the moving creature that hath life." Thus
the inhabitants of the sea and of the air were called
into existence; and it was from the sea that <span class="smcap">God</span>
seems to have commanded that they should derive
their being. He saw that it was good, and He blessed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>the fish and the winged fowl; "and the evening and
the morning were the fifth Day."</p>

<p>6. It remained only to provide for the dry land its
occupants; and the Earth was accordingly commanded
to bring forth the living creature after his kind,&mdash;beast
and cattle and creeping thing. Unlike that
first Creation which was of all things out of nothing,
the work of the six days was a creation of new things
out of old.&mdash;To the Creation of Man, His crowning
work, <span class="smcap">God</span> is declared to have come with deliberation;
as well as to have announced His purpose with significant
solemnity of allusion. "Let us make Man in
our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over the cattle." "And the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>
formed Man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became
a living soul."&mdash;Transferred to the Garden of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
planting in Eden, to dress it and to keep it, (for inactivity
is no part of bliss!)&mdash;and brought into solemn
covenant with <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;to Adam, <span class="smcap">God</span> brings the beasts
of the field and the fowls of the air, of set purpose that
<span class="smcap">God</span> may "see <i>what he will call them</i>:" a wondrous
tribute, truly, to the perfection of understanding in
which Man had been created!... "And the <span class="smcap">Lord
God</span> caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept: and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the
flesh instead thereof; and the rib which the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>
had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought
her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone
of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called
woman, because she was taken out of man. Therefore
shall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh." ...
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Man's creation was the crowning wonder, to which all
else had, in a manner, tended.... Truly when we think
of him,&mdash;newly made in <span class="smcap">God's</span> image,&mdash;surveying this
world, yet fresh with the dew of its birth, and beautiful
as it came from the Hands of its Maker,&mdash;it seems
scarcely the language of poetry that then "the morning
stars sang together and all the sons of <span class="smcap">God</span> shouted
for joy<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>."</p>

<p>I have preferred thus to complete the history of
Man's Creation; which presents us with the primal
institution of all,&mdash;that, namely, of Marriage.&mdash;"On
the seventh Day, <span class="smcap">God</span> rested from all His work which
He had made; and blessed the seventh Day, and
sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from
all His work."&mdash;This then is the other great prim&aelig;val
institution; more ancient than the Fall,&mdash;the Law of
the Sabbath;&mdash;which in the sacred record is brought
into such august prominence. And never do we
ponder over that record, without apprehension at
what may be the possible results of relaxing the
stringency of enactments which would seem to be, to
our nature, as the very twin pillars of the Temple,&mdash;its
establishment and its strength<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p>Now, on a review of all this wondrous History,
I profess myself at a loss to see what special note of
impracticability it presents that I should hesitate to
embrace it, in the plain natural sense of the words,
with both the arms of my heart. That it is not such
an account of the manner of the Creation as you or
I should have ourselves invented, or anticipated, or
on questionable testimony have felt disposed to accept,&mdash;is
very little to the purpose. Apart from Revelation,
we could really have known nothing at all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>about the works of the Days of the first Great Week.
Ejaculations therefore concerning the strangeness of
the record, and cavils at the phraseology in which it
is propounded, are simply irrelevant.</p>

<p>There exists however a vague suspicion after all
that the beginning of Genesis is a vision, or an allegory,
or a parable,&mdash;or anything you please, except
true History. It is hard to imagine <i>why</i>. If there
be a book in the whole Bible which purports to be
a plain historical narrative of actual events, <i>that</i> book
is the book of Genesis. In nine-tenths of its details,
it is as <i>human</i>, and as matter of fact, as any book of
Biography or History that ever was penned. <i>Why</i>
the first page of it is to be torn out, treated as a myth
or an allegory, and in short explained away,&mdash;I am
utterly at a loss to discover. There is no difference
in the style. Long since has the theory that Genesis
is composed of distinguishable fragments, been exploded<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.
There is no pretence for calling this first
chapter poetry, and treating it by a distinct set of
canons. It is a pure <i>Revelation</i>, I admit: but I have
yet to learn why the revelation of things intelligible,
where the method of speech is not such as to challenge
a figurative interpretation, is not to be taken literally:
unless indeed it has been discovered that a narrative
must of necessity be fabulous if the transactions referred
to are unusually remote and extraordinary. The
events recorded are unique in their character,&mdash;true.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>But this happens from the very necessity of the case.
The creation of a world, to the inhabitants of that
world is an unique event.</p>

<p>But we are assured that some of the statements in
this first chapter of Genesis are palpably untrue;&mdash;as
when it is said that the Sun, Moon, and Stars were
created on the fourth Day,&mdash;which, it is urged, is
a physical impossibility: for what forces else sustained,
and kept this world a sphere? The phenomena
of Geology again prove to demonstration, it is
said, that the structure of the earth is infinitely more
ancient than the Mosaic record states: and also that
there must have been Light, and sunshine too, at that
remote epoch,&mdash;which fostered each various form of
animal and vegetable life.&mdash;Further, we are assured
that it is unphilosophical to speak of the creation of
Light before the creation of the Sun.&mdash;Then, the
simplicity of the language is objected to:&mdash;"the
greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night:"&mdash;"dividing the light from the darkness:"&mdash;"waters
above the firmament:" and so forth.
The very ascription of speech to <span class="smcap">God</span>, gives offence.&mdash;Again,
some raw conceit of the advanced state of
the human intellect rejects with scorn the notion of
Adam oracularly bestowing names on <span class="smcap">God's</span> creatures.
Finally, the creation of Eve, moulded by <span class="smcap">God</span> from
the side of the Protoplast, is declared to savour so
plainly of the mythical, allegorical, or figurative; that
the narrative must be allowed to be altogether unworthy
of such wits as ours.</p>

<p>But we have seen that <i>the creation</i> of Sun, Moon,
and Stars is <i>not</i> assigned to the fourth day&mdash;but to
"<i>the beginning</i>"&mdash;The antiquity of this Earth we
affirm to be a circumstance left wholly untouched by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>the Mosaic record: or, if touched, it is rather confirmed;
for, before beginning to describe the work
of the first Day, Moses describes the state of "the
Earth" by two Hebrew words of most rare occurrence<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>,
which denote that it had become waste and empty:
while "the deep" is spoken of as being already in
existence.&mdash;There is nothing at all unphilosophical in
speaking of Light as existing apart from the Sun.
Rather would it be unphilosophical to speak of the
Sun as the source and centre of Light.&mdash;I see nothing
more childish again in the mention of "the greater
and the lesser light," than in the talk of "sun-rise"
and "sun-set,"&mdash;which is to this hour the language of
the Observatory.&mdash;As for attributing speech to <span class="smcap">God</span>,
I am content to remind you of Hooker's explanation
of the design of Moses therein, throughout the present
Chapter. "Was this only his intent," (he asks,)
"to signify the infinite greatness of <span class="smcap">God's</span> power by
the easiness of His accomplishing such effects without
travail, pain, or labour? Surely it seemeth that Moses
had herein besides this a further purpose; namely,
first to teach that <span class="smcap">God</span> did not work as a necessary,
but a voluntary agent, intending beforehand and decreeing
with Himself that which did outwardly proceed
from Him; secondly, to shew that <span class="smcap">God</span> did then
institute a Law natural to be observed by Creatures,
and therefore according to the manner of laws, the
institution thereof is described, as being established
by solemn injunction. His commanding those things
to be which are, and to be in such sort as they are, to
keep that tenure and course which they do, importeth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><i>the establishment of Nature's Law</i>.... And as it
cometh to pass in a kingdom rightly ordered, that
after a Law is once published, it presently takes effect
far and wide, all states framing themselves thereunto;
even so let us think that it fareth in the natural
course of the world. Since the time that <span class="smcap">God</span> did
first proclaim the edicts of His Law upon it, Heaven
and Earth have hearkened unto His voice, and their
labour hath been to do His will<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>."&mdash;"<i>He spake the
word</i>, and they were made: He commanded and they
were created. He hath made them fast for ever
and ever. <i>He hath given them a law which shall not
be broken<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.</i>"</p>

<p>Whether or no South overestimated Adam's knowledge,
I will not pretend to decide: but I am <i>convinced</i>
the truth lies more with him than with certain modern
wits, when he says concerning our first Father:&mdash;"He
came into the world a philosopher; which sufficiently
appeared by his writing the nature of things
upon their names.... His understanding could almost
pierce into future contingents; his conjectures improving
even to prophecy, or the certainties of prediction.
Till his Fall, he was ignorant of nothing but
sin.... There was then no struggling with memory,
no straining for invention. His faculties were ready
upon the first summons.... We may collect the excellency
of the understanding <i>then</i>, by the glorious
remainders of it now: and guess at the stateliness of
the building by the magnificence of its ruins.... And
certainly that must <i>needs</i> have been very glorious, the
decays of which are so admirable. He that is comely
when old and decrepit, surely was <i>very</i> beautiful when
he was young! An Aristotle was but the rubbish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>of an Adam; and Athens but the rudiments of
Paradise<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>."</p>

<p>And lastly, as for so much of the Divine narrative
as concerns the Creation of the first human pair, I am
content to remind you of a circumstance which in addressing
believers ought to be of overwhelming weight:
namely, that our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and His Apostles, again and
again, refer to the narrative before us in a manner
which precludes the notion of its being anything but
severest History. Our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span> even resyllables
the words spoken by the Protoplast in Paradise;
and therein finds a sanction for the indissoluble
nature of the marriage bond<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p>

<p>I take leave to add that even the respectful attempt
to make Genesis accommodate itself to the supposed
requirements of Geology, by boldly assuming that the
days of Creation were each a thousand years long,&mdash;seems
inadmissible. Even were such an hypothesis
allowed, nothing would be gained: for <i>Geology</i> does
not by any means require us to believe that after
a thousand years of misty light, there came a thousand
years of ocean deposit: and again, a thousand years
of moist and dry, during which vegetable life alone
prevailed: and then a thousand years of sun, moon,
and stars. The very notion seems absurd<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.&mdash;But,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>what is more to the purpose, such an interpretation
seems to stultify the whole narrative. A <i>week</i> is described.
<i>Days</i> are spoken of,&mdash;each made up of an
evening and a morning. <span class="smcap">God's</span> cessation from the work
of Creation on the Seventh Day is emphatically adduced
as the reason of the Fourth Commandment,&mdash;the
mysterious precedent for <i>our</i> observance of one
day of rest at the end of every six days of toil,&mdash;"<i>for</i>
in six days" (it is declared,) "the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made
Heaven and Earth<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>." You may not play tricks with
language plain as this, and elongate a week until
it shall more than embrace the span of all recorded
Time.</p>

<p>Neither am I able to see what would be gained by
proposing to prolong the Days of Creation indefinitely,
so as to consider them as representing vast and
unequal periods; (though I am far from presuming
to speak of <i>any</i> pious conjecture with disrespect.)
My inveterate objection to this scheme is again twofold.
(1)&nbsp;The best-ascertained requirements of Geology
are <i>not satisfied</i> by a <i>sixfold</i> division of phenomena
corresponding with what is recorded in Genesis
of the Six Days of Creation. (2)&nbsp;This method
does even greater violence to the letter of the inspired
narrative than the scheme of reconcilement
last hinted at.</p>

<p>I dare not believe that what has been spoken will
altogether meet the requirements of minds of a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>stamp. A gentleman, who certainly has the advantage
of appearing in good company, has lately favoured
the world with the information that the first chapter
of Genesis is the uninspired speculation of a Hebrew
astronomer, who was bent on giving "the best and
most probable account that could be then given of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> universe<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>." The Hebrew writer asserts indeed
"solemnly and unhesitatingly that for which he must
have known that he had no authority<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>;" but we need
not therefore "attribute to him wilful misrepresentation,
or consciousness of asserting that which he knew
not to be true<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>." If this "early speculator" "asserted
as facts what he knew in reality only as probabilities,"
it was because he was not harassed by
the scruples which result "from our modern habits of
thought, and from the modesty of assertion which the
spirit of true science has taught us<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>." The history of
this important discovery and of others of a similar
nature, (which, by the way, are one and all announced
with the same "modesty of assertion" as what goes
before,) would appear to be this.&mdash;Natural science has
lately woke up from her long slumber of well nigh
sixty ages; and with that immodesty for which youth
and inexperience have ever been proverbial, she is
impatient to measure her crude theories against the
sure revelation of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word. Where the two differ,
she assumes that of course the inspired Oracles are
wrong, and her own wild guesses right. She is even
indecent in her eagerness to invalidate the testimony
of that Book which has been the confidence and stay
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Servants in all ages. On any evidence, or
on none, she is prepared to hurl to the winds the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>august record of Creation. Inconveniently enough
for the enemies of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word, every advance in
Geological Science does but serve to corroborate the
record that the Creation <i>of Man</i> is not to be referred
to a remoter period than some six thousand years ago.
But of this important fact we hear but little. On the
other hand, no trumpet is thought loud enough to
bruit about <i>a suspicion</i> that Man may be a creature of
yet remoter date. Thus, fragments of burnt brick found
fifty feet below the surface of the banks of the Nile,
were hailed as establishing Man's existence in Egypt
more than 13,000 years; until it was unhappily remembered
that <i>burnt</i> brick in Egypt belongs to the
period of the Roman dominion.&mdash;More recently, implements
of chipped flint found, with some bones, in
a bed of gravel, have been eagerly appealed to as
a sufficient indication that the Creation of Man is to
be referred to a period at least 10,000 years more remote
than is fixed by the Chronology of the Bible....
Brick and flint! a precious fulcrum, truly, for
a theory which is to upset the World!</p>

<p>But I shall be told,&mdash;with that patronizing air of
conscious intellectual superiority which a certain class
of gentlemen habitually assume on such occasions,&mdash;that
I mistake the case completely: that no wish is
entertained in any quarter to invalidate the truth of
Revelation, or to shake Men's confidence in the Bible
as the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>: that it has been the way of
narrow-minded bigots in all ages, and is so in this,
to raise an outcry of the Bible being in danger, and
so to rouse the prejudices of mankind: that the error
lies in claiming for the Bible an office which it nowhere
claims for itself, and which it was never meant
to fulfil: that the harmony between the Bible and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Nature is complete, but that it is not <i>such</i> a harmony
as is sometimes imagined: that the Bible is not a
scientific book, and was never meant to teach Natural
Science: that it was designed to inculcate moral goodness,
and is clearly full of unscientific statements,
which it is the office of Science to correct; and, if
need be, to remove. All this, and much beside, I
shall be told. Such fallacious platitudes have been
put forth by men who are neither Divines nor Philosophers,
<i>ad nauseam</i>, within the last forty or fifty years.</p>

<p>Now, in reply, we have a few words to say. The
profession of faithfulness we hail with pleasure: the
imputation of imbecility we accept with unconcern.
But when gentlemen tell us that the Bible was never
meant to teach Science; and that wherever its statements
are opposed to the clear inductions of reason,
they must give way; and so forth: we take the liberty
of retaliating their charge. We inform them that <i>they</i>
really mistake the case entirely. When they go on
to tell us that they believe in the truth of the Bible
as sincerely as ourselves: that its harmonies are complete,
but not such as we imagine; and so forth;&mdash;we
venture to add that they really know not what
they assert. In plain language, they talk nonsense.
Of a simple unbeliever we know at least what to
think. But what is to be thought of persons who
disbelieve just whatever they dislike, and yet profess
to be just as hearty believers as you or I?</p>

<p>That the Mosaic record of Creation has been thought
at variance with certain deductions of modern observation,
is not surprising: seeing that the deductions
of each fresh period have been at variance with the
deductions of that which went before; and seeing
that the theory of one existing school is inconsistent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>with the theory of another.&mdash;That the Bible is not, in
any sense, <i>a scientific treatise</i> again, is simply a truism:
(who ever supposed that it was?). Moses writes "the
history of the Human Race as regards Sin and Salvation:
not a cosmical survey of all the successive
phenomena of the globe<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>." Further, that he employs
popular phraseology when speaking of natural phenomena,
is a statement altogether undeniable. But such
remarks are a gross fallacy, and a mere deceit, if it
be meant that the statements in the Bible partake of
the imperfection of knowledge incident to a rude and
primitive state of society. To revive an old illustration,&mdash;Is
a philosopher therefore a child, because, in
addressing children, he uses language adapted to their
age and capacity? <span class="smcap">God</span> speaks in the First Chapter
of Genesis,&mdash;<i>hath</i> spoken for three and thirty hundred
years,&mdash;as unto children: but there is no risk therefore
that in what He saith, He either hath deceived,
or will deceive mankind.</p>

<p>You are never to forget the great fundamental position,
that the Bible claims to be the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>;
and that <i><span class="smcap">God's</span> Word can never contradict or be contradicted
by <span class="smcap">God's</span> works</i>. We therefore reject, <i>in limine</i>,
all insinuations about the "unscientific" character of
the Bible. A scientific man does not cease to be scientific
because he does not choose always to express
himself scientifically. Again. A man of universal
Science does not forfeit his scientific reputation, if,
in the course of a <i>moral</i> or <i>religious</i> argument, his
allusions to <i>natural</i> phenomena are expressed in the
ordinary language of mankind. Even so, Almighty
God, "in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>and knowledge<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>,"&mdash;speaking to us by the mouth of
His holy Prophets, never, that I am aware, teaches
them to speak a strictly scientific language,&mdash;<i>except
when the Science of Theology is being discoursed of</i>. On
other occasions, He suffers their language to be like
yours or mine. "Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>:"&mdash;"The
clouds drop down the dew<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>:"&mdash;"The wind
bloweth where it listeth<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>."&mdash;Not so when <i>Theology</i>
is the subject. <i>Then</i> the language becomes scientific.
"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>:"&mdash;"Take,
eat, This is My Body<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>:"&mdash;"Before Abraham was,
I am<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>:"&mdash;"I and the <span class="smcap">Father</span> are One<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>."</p>

<p>But there is this great difference between the cases
supposed. A man of universal scientific attainment
will be less strong in one subject than another: and
in the course of his <i>Geological</i> allusions, if <i>Mechanical</i>
Science be his forte,&mdash;in the course of his <i>Metaphysical</i>
allusions, if <i>Mathematical</i> Science be his proper department,&mdash;he
may easily err. Above all, the limits of
the knowledge of unassisted Man must infallibly be
those of the age in which he lives. But, with the
Ancient of Days, it is not so. <i>He</i> at least <i>cannot</i> err.
Nothing that man has ever discovered by laborious
induction was not known to Him from the beginning:
nothing that <i>He</i> hath ever commissioned His servants
to deliver, will be found inconsistent with the anterior
facts of History. "He that <i>made</i> the eye, shall <i>He</i>
not see<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>?" The records of Creation then <i>cannot</i> be
incorrect. The course of Man's history <i>must</i> be that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>which, speaking by the mouth of His Prophets, <span class="smcap">God</span>
hath described.</p>

<p>"I never said the contrary," is the reply. "All
I say is that you interpret the records of Creation
wrongly: and that you are disposed to lay greater
stress on the historical accuracy of the Bible than the
narrative will bear."</p>

<p>O but, sir, whoever you may be who censure me
thus, let me in all kindness warn you of the pit, at the
very edge whereof you stand!</p>

<p>Far be it from such an one as the preacher to assume
that he so apprehends the First Chapter of Genesis,
that if an Angel were to turn interpreter, he might
not convince me of more than one misapprehension in
matters of detail. But of this, at least, I am <i>quite</i>
certain; that when I find it recorded that <span class="smcap">God</span> took
counsel about Man's Creation: and made him in "His
own image," and "breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life," whereby man became "a living soul:" and
further, when I find it stated that Adam bestowed
names upon all creatures: and spake oracularly of his
spouse:&mdash;I am <i>certain</i>, I say, when I read such things,
that <span class="smcap">God</span> intended me to believe that Man was created
with a Godlike understanding, and with the perfect
fruition of the prim&aelig;val speech. Further, I boldly
assert that he who could prove the contradictory,
would make the Bible, even as a Theological Book,
nothing worth, to you and me.</p>

<p>The same must be said of the Bible chronology.
And here I will adopt the words of one who is justly
entitled to be listened to in this place; and who must
at least be allowed to be a competent judge of the
matter, for he made Chronology his province. Mr.
Clinton says:&mdash;"Those who imagine themselves at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>liberty to enlarge the time [which elapsed from the
Creation to the Deluge, and from the Deluge to the
Birth of Abraham,] to an indefinite amount,&mdash;mistake
the nature of the question. The uncertainty here is
not an uncertainty arising from want of testimony:
(like that which occurs in the early chronology of
Greece, and of many other countries; when the times
are uncertain because no evidence is preserved.) ...
The uncertainty here is of a peculiar character, belonging
to this particular case. The evidence exists,
but in a double form; and we have to decide which is
the authentic and genuine copy. But if the one is
rejected, the other is established:" the difference between
the two being exactly 1,250 years.&mdash;Men are
free to <i>reject</i> the evidence, to be sure; but we defy
them to <i>explain it away</i>. The chronological details of
the Bible are as emphatically set down as anything
can be; and,&mdash;(with the exception of a few particulars,
chiefly in the Book of Kings, which are to the record
what misprints are to a printed book,)&mdash;they are entirely
consistent; and hang perfectly well together.
Let us not be told, then, that we entertain groundless
apprehensions for the authority of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word when
we hear it proposed to refer the Creation of Man to
a period of unheard-of antiquity. Destroy my confidence
in the Bible as an historical record, and you
destroy my confidence in it altogether; for by far the
largest part of the Bible <i>is</i> an historical record. If
the Creation of Man,&mdash;the longevity of the Patriarchs,&mdash;the
account of the Deluge;&mdash;if <i>these</i> be not
true histories, what is to be said of the lives of Abraham,
of Jacob, of Joseph, of Moses, of Joshua, of
David,&mdash;of our <i>Saviour Christ</i> Himself?</p>

<p>But there is a scornful spirit abroad which is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>content to allegorize the earlier pages of the Bible,&mdash;to
scoff at the story of the Flood, to reject the outlines
of Scripture Chronology;&mdash;but which would dispute
the most emphatic details of Revelation itself.
Consistent, this method is, at all events. Let it have
the miserable praise which is so richly its due. To
logical consistency, it may at least lay claim. It refuses
to stop anywhere: as why should it stop? Faith
is denied her office, because Reason fails to see the reasonableness
of Faith: and accordingly, unbelief enters
in with a flood-tide. Miracles, for example, are now
to be classed, (we learn,) among "the difficulties" of
Christianity<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. It was to have been expected. (<i>Who</i>
foresees not what must be the fate of such "difficulties"
as these?) And will you tell me that you
may reject the miraculous transactions recorded in
the Old and New Testaments, and yet retain the narrative
which contains them? That were indeed absurd!
Will you then reject one miracle and retain
another? Impossible! You can make no reservation,
even in favour of the Incarnation of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;the
most adorable of all miracles, as it is the very keystone
of our Christian hope. Either, with the best
and wisest of all ages, you must believe <i>the whole</i> of
Holy Scripture; or, with the narrow-minded infidel,
you must <i>dis</i>believe the whole. There is no middle
course open to you.</p>

<p>Do we then undervalue the discoveries of Natural
Science; or view with jealousy the progress she has
of late been making? <span class="smcap">God</span> forbid! With unfeigned
joy we welcome her honest triumphs, as so many
fresh evidences of the wisdom, the power, the goodness
of <span class="smcap">God</span>. "Thou, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, hast made me glad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>through Thy works<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>!" The very guesses of Geology
are precious. What are they but noble endeavours
to unfold a page anterior to the first page of the
Bible; or rather, to discover what secrets are locked
up in the first verse of it? But when, instead of
being a faithful Servant, Natural Science affects the
airs of an imperious Mistress,&mdash;what can she hope to
incur at the hands of Theology, but displeasure and
contempt? She forgets her proper place, and overlooks
her lawful function. She prates about the laws
of Nature in the presence of Him who, when He
created the Universe, invented those very laws, and
impressed them on His irrational creatures.&mdash;Does it
never humble her to reflect that it was but yesterday
she detected the fundamental Law of Gravitation?
Does she never blush with shame to consider that for
well nigh six thousand years men have been inquisitively
walking this Earth's surface; and yet, that, one
hundred years ago, the provident notions concerning
fossil remains, and the Earth's structure, were such
as now-a-days would be pronounced incredibly ridiculous
and absurd?</p>

<p>To conclude. The very phraseology with which
men have presumed to approach this entire question,
is insolent and unphilosophical. The popular phraseology
of the day, I say, hardly covers, so as to conceal,
a lie. We constantly find <span class="smcap">Science</span> and <span class="smcap">Theology</span>
opposed to one another: just as if Theology were <i>not</i>
a Science! History forsooth, with all her inaccuracy
of observation, is a Science: and Geology, with all
her weak guesses, is a Science: and comparative Anatomy,
with nothing but her laborious inductions to
boast of, is a Science: but Theology,&mdash;which is based
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>on the express revelation of the Eternal,&mdash;is some
other thing! What do you mean to tell us that Theology
is, but the very queen of Sciences? Would
Aristotle have bestowed on Ethic the epithet &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8053;,
think you, had he known of that &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;,
which his friend,&mdash;"not blind by choice, but destined
not to see<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>,"&mdash;felt after yet found not? that
"more excellent way," which you and I, by <span class="smcap">God's</span>
great mercy, possess? Go to! For popular purposes,
if you will, let the word "Science" stand for the
knowledge of the phenomena of Nature; somewhat as,
in this place, the word stands for the theory of Morals,
and some of the phenomena of Mind: and so, let
Science be contrasted with <span class="smcap">Theology</span>, without offence
taken, because none is intended. But let it never
be forgotten that Theology is <i>the</i> great Science of all,&mdash;the
only Science which really deserves the name.
What have other sciences to boast of which Theology
has not? Antiquity,&mdash;such as no other can, in any
sense, lay claim to: a Literature,&mdash;which is absolutely
without a rival: a Terminology,&mdash;which reflects the
very image of all the ages: Professors,&mdash;of loftier
wit, from the days of Athanasius and Augustine,
down to the days of our own Hooker and Butler,&mdash;men
of higher mark, intellectually and morally,&mdash;than
adorn the annals of any other Science since the
World began: above all things, a subject-matter,
which is the grandest imagination can conceive; and
a foundation, which has all the breadth, and length,
and depth and height<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>, which the Hands of <span class="smcap">God</span>
Himself could give it.</p>

<p>For subject-matter, what Science will you compare
with this? All the others in the world will not bring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>a man to the knowledge of <span class="smcap">God</span> and of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>! They
will not inform him of the will of <span class="smcap">God</span>, although they
may teach him to observe His Works. "The Heavens
declare the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>,"&mdash;but, as Lord Bacon remarked
long since, we do not read that they declare
His will. Neither do the other sciences of necessity
lead to any belief at all in the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Revelation<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

<p>And, for that whereon they are built, what Science
again will you compare with this? Let the pretender
to Geological skill,&mdash;(I say not the true Geologist, for
<i>he</i> never offends!)&mdash;let the conceited sciolist, I say, go
dream a little longer over those implements of chipped
flint which have called him into such noisy activity,&mdash;and
discover, as he <i>will</i> discover, that the assumed
inference from the gravel and the bones is fallacious
after all<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.&mdash;Let the Historian go spell a little longer
over that moth-eaten record of dynasties which never
were, by means of which he proposes to set right the
clock of Time<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. Let the Naturalist walk round the
stuffed or bleached wonders of his museum, and guess
again<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. Theological Science not so! <i>Her</i> evidence
is sure, for her Rule is <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word. No laborious
Induction here,&mdash;fallacious because imperfect; imperfect
because human: but a direct message from the
presence-chamber of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of Heaven and Earth,&mdash;decisive
because inspired; infallible because Divine.
The express Revelation of the Eternal is that whereon
Theological Science builds her fabric of imperishable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Truth: <i>that</i> fabric which, while other modes change,
shift, and at last become superseded, shines out,&mdash;yea,
and to the very end of Time will shine out,&mdash;unconscious
of decay, incapable of improvement, far,
far beyond the reach of fashion: a thing unchanged,
because in its very nature unchangeable<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>!</p>

<p>O sirs,&mdash;we are constrained to be brief in this place.
The field must perforce be narrowed; and so, for this
time, it must suffice to have warned you against the
men who resort to the armoury of Natural Science
for weapons wherewith to assail <span class="smcap">God's</span> Truth. Regard
them as the enemies of your peace; and learn
to reject their specious, yet most inconsequential reasonings,
with the scorn which is properly their due.
Contempt and scorn <span class="smcap">God</span> implanted in us, precisely
that we might bestow them on reasonings worthless
in their texture, and foul in their object, as these;
which teach distrust of the earlier pages of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Word, on the pretence that they are contradicted by
the evidence of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Works. Learn to abhor that
spurious liberality which is liberal only with what is
<i>not its own</i>; and which reminds one of nothing so
much as the conduct of leprous persons who are said
to be for ever seeking to communicate and extend
their own unhappy taint to others. I allude to that
sham liberality which under pretence of extending the
common standing ground of Christian men, is in reality
attenuating it until it proves incapable of bearing the
weight of a single soul. There is room on the Rock
for all; but it is only on the Rock that we are safe.
To speak without a figure,&mdash;He who surrenders the
first page of his Bible, surrenders all. He knows not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>where to stop. Nay, you and I cannot in any way
<i>afford</i> to surrender the beginning of Genesis; simply
because upon the truth of what is there recorded
depends the whole scheme of Man's salvation,&mdash;the
need of that "second Man" which is "the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> from
Heaven<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>." It is not too much to say that the beginning
of Genesis is the foundation on which all the rest
of the Bible is built<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. We may not go over to those
who would mutilate the Book of Life, or evacuate any
part of its message. It is they, on the contrary, who
must come over to us.&mdash;Much has it been the fashion
of these last days, (I cannot imagine why,) to vaunt
the character and the Gospel of St. John, "the disciple
of Love," as he is called; as if it were secretly thought
that there is a latitudinarianism in Love which would
wink at Doctrinal obliquity; whereas <i>St. John is the
Evangelist of Dogma</i>; and if there be anything in the
world which is <i>jealous</i>, that thing is <i>Love</i>. Indifference
to Truth, and laxity of Belief, are the growing
characteristics of the age. But you will find that
St. John has about four or five times as much about
<span class="smcap">Truth</span> as all the other three Evangelists; while <i>the act</i>
of Faith receives as frequent mention in his writings
alone as in all the rest of the New Testament Canon
put together<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.</p>

<p>Let me end, as the manner of preachers is, by
gathering out of what has been spoken one brief practical
consideration.&mdash;This whole visible frame of things
wherein we play our part, is hastening to decay.
Everything we behold,&mdash;ourselves included,&mdash;carries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>with it the prophecy of its own speedy dissolution.&mdash;What,
amid the wreck of worlds, will be our confidence?... It
is an inquiry worth making, in these
the days of health, and vigour, and security, and
peace. O my soul, (learn to ask yourselves,)&mdash;O my
soul, when the Heavens shall depart, and the Earth
reel before the Second Advent of its Maker;&mdash;when
the Sun puts on mourning, and the very powers of
Heaven are shaken;&mdash;what shall be <i>our</i> confidence,&mdash;<i>our</i>
hope,&mdash;in that tremendous day? Whither shall
we betake ourselves, amid the overthrow of universal
Nature, but to the sure mercies of Him who "in the
beginning created the Heaven and the Earth?"&mdash;To
those strong Hands, we intend, (<span class="smcap">God</span> helping us!)
with unswerving confidence to commend our fainting
spirits<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>.... <i>Him</i>, then, in life let us learn to reverence,
on whom in death we propose so implicitly to
lean! And we only know Him in, and through, and
by His <span class="smcap">Word</span>. Nor can we in any surer way shew
Him reverence or dishonour, than by the manner in
which we receive His message,&mdash;yea, by the spirit in
which we unfold this, the first page of it,&mdash;where
stands recorded that prim&aelig;val act of Almighty power
which is the ground of all our confidence,&mdash;the very
warrant for our own security.... "Blessed" of a
truth, in that day, will he be, "that hath the <span class="smcap">God</span>
of Jacob for his help, and whose hope is in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
his <span class="smcap">God</span>:&mdash;<i>who made the Heaven and the Earth,&mdash;the
Sea and all that therein is:&mdash;who keepeth His promise
for ever</i><a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>!"</p>

I find myself called on, as a geologist, to account for but three out
of the six. Of the period during which light was created; of the
period during which a firmament was made to separate the waters
from the waters; or of the period during which the two great lights
of the earth, with the other heavenly bodies, became visible from
the Earth's surface;&mdash;we need expect to find no record in the rocks."&mdash;<i>Testimony</i>,

But the first three days remain to be accounted for <i>by somebody</i>, all

so, I suppose, do the <i>first</i> three.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>2 Tim. iii. 16.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.</i></p></div>


<p>But <i>that</i> is not exactly what St. Paul says. The
Greek for <i>that</i>, would be &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#7977; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8053;&mdash;not
&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052;&mdash;&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#962;. St. Paul does not say
that <i>the whole</i> of Scripture, collectively, is inspired.
More than <i>that</i>: what he says is, that <i>every writing</i>,&mdash;every
<i>several book</i> of those &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8048; &#947;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, or Holy
Scriptures, in which Timothy had been instructed
from his childhood,&mdash;is inspired by God<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. It <i>comes</i>
to very nearly the same thing; but it is <i>not</i> quite
the same thing. St. Paul is careful to remind us that
every Book in the Bible is an inspired Book<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>this statement is not confined to one place.&mdash;Elsewhere,
he calls his message "the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>;"
and says that it had been received by the disciples
not as the Word of Men, but as it is in truth, the
Word of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.&mdash;Elsewhere, "Which things also we
speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth,
but which the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> teacheth<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>:"&mdash;where, if
I at all understand the Apostle, (and he speaks very
plainly!) he says that <i>his words</i> were inspired by the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>.&mdash;Accordingly, St. Peter declares that
the Epistles of his "beloved brother Paul" are part
of the Holy Scriptures<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>;&mdash;Divinely inspired, therefore,
like all the rest.</p>

<p>But does not St. Paul himself in a certain place
express a doubt&mdash;saying "I <i>think</i> that I have the
Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>?" and does he not contrast his own
sayings with the Divine sayings, ("not I but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><span class="smcap">Lord</span><a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>"), clearly implying that his own were <i>not</i>
Divine? and does he not say that he delivers certain
things "by permission, and not of commandment<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>,"
whereby he seems to insinuate a gradation of authority
in what he delivers?&mdash;No. Not one of these
things does he do. He says, indeed, of a certain hint
to married persons that he offers it "by way of <i>advice</i>
to them not by way of <i>precept</i>:" but <i>giving advice</i>
to <i>men</i> is a very different thing from <i>receiving permission</i>
from <span class="smcap">God</span>. Again, "Unto the married," (he
says,) "I command, yet not I but the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,"&mdash;alluding
to our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> words, as set down by St. Matthew,
chap. xix. verse 6<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>; which is simply an historical
allusion to the Gospel.&mdash;So far from "<i>thinking</i>"
he had the Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>, (as if it were an open question
whether he had it or not,) he says the very contrary.
&#916;&#959;&#954;&#8051;&#969;, in all such places, implies, not <i>doubt</i>
but <i>certainty<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></i>: (as when our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> asks,&mdash;-"Doth he
thank that servant because he did the things commanded
him? &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#8182;,"&mdash;I fancy not indeed<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>!) On
St. Paul's lips, as every scholar knows, the phrase is
not one of doubt, but one of indignant, or at least
emphatic asseveration<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.&mdash;A man had need be very
sure he <i>understands</i> the record, (let me just remark in
passing,) before he presumes to criticize it.</p>

<p>"<i>The Spirit of <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i>" is said by St. Peter to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>been "<i>in the prophets</i><a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>:" and in another place he declares
that they "<i>spake as they were moved by the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span></i><a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>." The <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> accordingly is said to
have spoken the xlist Psalm "by the mouth of
David<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>." The xcvth Psalm is declared absolutely to
be the utterance of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span><a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>. Once, the cxth
Psalm is ascribed simply to <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>; and once, to David
speaking under the influence of <i>the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span></i><a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. The
iind Psalm is described as the language of <span class="smcap">God</span> the
<span class="smcap">Father</span> "by the mouth of His Servant David<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>."
"<i>Well spake the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span></i> by Esaias the Prophet
unto our Fathers<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>,"&mdash;was the exclamation of the
Apostle Paul, quoting the 9th and 10th verses of his
vith chapter. When Jeremiah speaks, the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>
is declared, (not Jeremiah, <i>but the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span></i>) to witness
unto us<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>. The assertion is express that it was
"<span class="smcap">God</span>" who, "<i>by the mouth of all His Prophets</i>," foretold

but the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of your Father, <i>which speaketh in you</i><a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>."
And this promise became so famous, that St. Paul
says the Corinthians challenged him to <i>prove</i> that
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> was speaking in him<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.... But why multiply
places? The use which our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> makes in the
New Testament of the words of the Old,&mdash;from the
writings of Moses to the writings of Malachi,&mdash;would
be simply nugatory unless those words were much
more than human. And the record of the Apostle is
express and emphatic:&mdash;"All Scripture&mdash;every Book
of the Bible,&mdash;is given <i>by Inspiration of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>."&mdash;In
the face of such testimony, by the way, we deem it
not a little extraordinary to be assured (by an individual
who has acquired considerable notoriety within
the last few months) that "for any of the higher or
supernatural views of Inspiration there is no foundation
in the Gospels or Epistles<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>."</p>

<p>Strange to say, there is a marvellous indisposition
in Man to admit the notion of such a heaven-sent
message. Not to dispute with those who deny Inspiration
altogether, (for that would be endless,) there
are many,&mdash;and, we fear, a daily increasing number
of persons,&mdash;who, admitting Inspiration in terms, yet
so mutilate the notion of it, that their admission becomes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>a practical lie. "St. Paul was inspired, no doubt.
So was Shakspeare." He who says this, intending
no quibble, declares that in his belief St. Paul was
<i>not inspired at all</i>.</p>

<p>But this is a monstrous case, with which I will not
waste your time. Far more numerous are they, who,
admitting that the Authors of the Bible were inspired
in quite a different sense from Homer and Dante, are
yet for modifying and qualifying this admission after
so many strange and arbitrary fashions, that the residuum
of their belief is really worth very little. One
man has a mental reservation of exclusion in favour of
the two Books of Chronicles, or the Book of Esther,
or of Daniel.&mdash;Another, is content to eliminate from
the Bible those passages which seem to him to run
counter to the decrees of physical Science;&mdash;the History
of the Six Days of Creation,&mdash;of the Flood,&mdash;of
the destruction of Sodom,&mdash;and of Joshua's address to
Sun and Moon.&mdash;Another regards it as self-evident
that nothing is trustworthy which savours supremely
of the marvellous;&mdash;as the Temptation of our first
Parents,&mdash;the Manna in the Wilderness,&mdash;Balaam reproved
by the dumb ass,&mdash;and the history of Jonah.&mdash;There
are others who cannot tolerate the Miracles of
the Old and the New Testament. The more timid,
explain away as much of them as they dare. What
remains, troubles them. The more logical sweep them
away altogether. A miracle (they say) cannot be true
because it implies a violation of the fixed and immutable
laws of Nature.</p>

<p>And then,&mdash;(so strangely constituted are some men's
minds,)&mdash;there are not a few persons who, without
exactly denying the inspiration of the Bible in any of
its more marvellous portions,&mdash;(for <i>that</i> would be an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>inconvenient proceeding,)&mdash;are yet content to regard
much of it as a kind of inspired myth. This is a class
of ally (?) with whom one really knows not how to
deal. The man does not reason. He assumes his
right to disbelieve, and yet will not allow that he is
an unbeliever. The world is singularly indulgent
toward persons of this unphilosophical, illogical, presumptuous
class.</p>

<p>Now, I shall have something to say to all these
different kinds of objectors, on some subsequent occasion.
But I shall be rendering the younger men
a far more important service if to-day I address my
remarks to a different class of objectors altogether:
<i>that</i> far larger body, I mean, who without at all desiring
to impugn the Inspiration of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Oracles, yet
make no secret of their belief that the Bible is full of
inaccuracies and misstatements. These men ascribe
a truly liberal amount of human infirmity to the
Authors of the several Books of the Bible;&mdash;slips of
memory, misconceptions, imperfect intelligence, partial
illumination, and so forth;&mdash;and, under one or other
of those heads, include whatever they are themselves
disposed to reject. The writers who come in for the
largest share of this indulgence, are the Evangelists;
because the Historians of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> life, having happily
left us four versions of the same story, and often
three versions of the same transaction, the evidence
whereby <i>they</i> may be convicted of error is in the
hands of all. Truly, mankind has not been slow to
avail itself of the opportunity. You will seldom hear
a Gospel difficulty discussed, without a quiet assumption
on the part of the Reverend gentleman that <i>he</i>
knows all about the matter in question, but that the
Evangelist did <i>not</i>. His usual method is, calmly to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>inform us that it is useless to look for strict consistency
in matters of minute detail; that <i>general
agreement</i> between the four Evangelists there does
exist, and <i>that</i> ought to be enough. The inevitable inference
from his manner of handling the Gospels, is,
that if his actual thoughts could find candid expression,
we should hear him address their blessed authors somewhat
as follows:&mdash;"You are four highly respectable
characters, no doubt; and you <i>mean</i> well. But it
cannot be expected that persons of your condition in
life should have described so many intricate transactions
so minutely without making blunders. I do
not say it unkindly. I often make blunders myself,&mdash;<i>I</i>,
who have a "clearness of understanding," "a power
of discrimination between different kinds of Truth<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>"
unknown to the Apostolic Age!" ... Of course the
preacher does not <i>say</i> all this. He has too keen
a sense of "the dignity of the pulpit." And so he
puts it somewhat thus:&mdash;"While we are disposed to
recognize substantial agreement, and general conformity
in respect of details, among the synoptical
witnesses, in their leading external outlines, we are
yet constrained to withhold our unqualified acceptance
of any theory of Inspiration which should claim
for these compilers exemption from the oscitancy, and
generally from the infirmities of humanity." ... This
sounds fine, you know; and is thought an ingenious
way of wrapping up the charge which the Reverend
preacher brings against the Evangelists;&mdash;of having,
in plain terms,&mdash;<i>made blunders</i>.</p>

<p>It will be convenient that we should narrow the
ground to this single issue: for the time is short.
And in the remarks I am about to offer, I shall not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>imitate the example of those preachers who dress out
an easy thought in a superfluity of inflated language,
only in order that its deformity may escape detection.
Be not surprised if I speak to you this morning in
uncommonly plain English; for I am determined that
the simplest person present shall understand at least
what <i>I</i> mean. The dignity of the Blessed Evangelists,
who walked with <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and whom <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> loved,&mdash;the
dignity of that Gospel which I believe to be penetrated
through and through with the Holy Spirit of
<span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;for <i>that</i>, I confess to a most unbounded jealousy.
As for the "dignity of the pulpit,"&mdash;I hate the very
phrase! It has been made too often the shield of
impiety and the cloak of dulness.</p>

<p>To begin, then,&mdash;Is it, I would ask you, a reasonable
anticipation that the narrative of one inspired
by <span class="smcap">God</span> would prove full of inconsistencies, misstatements,
slips of memory:&mdash;or indeed, that it should
contain <i>any</i> misstatements, <i>any</i> inaccuracies at all?
What then is the difference between an inspired and
an uninspired writing,&mdash;the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span> and the
Word of Man?</p>

<p>The answer which I shall receive, is obvious. As
a matter of fact (it is replied) there <i>are</i> these inaccuracies:
that is, the same transaction is described
by two or more writers, and their accounts prove inconsistent.
Thus, St. Matthew begins his account of
the healing of the blind at Jericho, with the words,&mdash;"And
as they were <i>going out</i> of Jericho:" but
St. Luke, "While He was <i>drawing nigh</i> to Jericho."&mdash;There
<i>are</i> these slips of memory; as when St. Matthew
ascribes to "Jeremy the prophet" words which are
found in the prophet Zechariah.&mdash;There <i>are</i> these
misstatements, as where the Census of the Nativity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>is said to have taken place under the presidentship of
Cyrenius.&mdash;And these are but samples of a mighty
class of difficulties, (it is urged:)&mdash;the two Genealogies;
the Call of the four Disciples; the healing of
the Centurion's servant; the title on the Cross; the
history of the Resurrection:&mdash;and again, "the sixteenth
of Tiberius;" "the days of Abiathar;" with
many others.&mdash;Let me then briefly discuss the three
examples first cited,&mdash;which really came spontaneously.
Each is the type of a class; and the answer
to one is, in reality, applicable to all the rest. I humbly
ask for your patience and attention; promising that
I will abuse neither, though I must tax both.</p>

<p>The great fundamental truth to be first laid down,
is <i>this</i>&mdash;that the Gospels are not <i>four</i>&mdash;but <i>one</i>. The
Ancients knew this very well. &#917;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8050;&#957;
&#964;&#8051;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#962;,&mdash;&#917;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#8051;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#7957;&#957;&mdash;says Origen<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>: "the
Gospel-<i>writers</i> are four,&mdash;but the <i>Gospel</i> is one."
And the ancients recorded this mighty verity four
times over on the first page of the Gospel, lest it
should ever be forgotten; and there it stands to this
day:&mdash;the Gospel,&mdash;the <i>one</i> Gospel &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;,&mdash;<i>according
to</i>&mdash;St. Matthew,&mdash;<i>according to</i> St. Mark,&mdash;<i>according
to</i> St. Luke,&mdash;<i>according to</i> St. John. Like that river
which went out of Eden to water the Garden,&mdash;it was
by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> "parted, and became into four
heads."&mdash;The Gospels therefore, (to call them by
their common name,) are not to be regarded as four
witnesses, or rather as four culprits, brought up on
a charge of fraud. Rather are they Angelic voices
singing in sweetest harmony, but after a method of
Heavenly counterpoint which must be studied before
it can be understood of Men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
And next,&mdash;There is one great principle, and one
only, which needs to be borne in mind for the effectual
reconciliation of <i>every discrepancy</i> which the four
narratives present: namely, that you should approach
them in exactly the same spirit in which you approach
the statement of any man of honour of your
acquaintance. Whether the Apostles of the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>,&mdash;men
whom we believe to have been inspired by the
Holy Spirit of the Everlasting <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;are not entitled
to far higher respect, far higher consideration, at our
hands,&mdash;I leave <i>you</i> to decide. As one whose joy
and crown it has been to weigh every word in the
Gospel in hair-scales, I am prepared to risk the issue.
Be only as fair to the four Evangelists as you are
to one another; and I am quite confident about the
result.</p>

<p>I appeal to the experience of every thoughtful man
among you who has at all given his mind to the subject
of evidence, whether it be not the fact,&mdash;(1st)
That when two or more persons are giving true versions
of the same incident, their accounts will sometimes
differ so considerably, that it will seem at first
sight as if they could not possibly be reconciled: and
yet (2ndly), That a single word of explanation, the
discovery of one minute circumstance,&mdash;perfectly natural
when we hear it stated, yet most unlikely and
unlooked-for,&mdash;will often suffice to remove the difficulty
which before seemed unsurmountable; and further,
that when this has been done, the entire consistency
of the several accounts becomes apparent;
while the harmony which is established is often of the
most beautiful nature. (3rdly) That when (for whatever
reason) two or more versions of the same incident
are <i>not</i> correct, no ingenuity can ever possibly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>reconcile them, <i>as they stand</i>. They lean apart in
hopeless divergence. In other words, they <i>contradict</i>
one another.</p>

<p>Now, these principles are fully admitted in daily
life. If your friend comes to you with ever so improbable
a tale, the last thing which enters into your
mind is to disbelieve him. Is he in earnest? Yes,
on his honour. Is he sure he is not mistaken? <i>That</i>
very doubt of yours requires an apology: but your
friend says,&mdash;"I am as sure as I am of my existence."
"Give it me under your hand and seal then." Your
friend begins to suspect your sanity; but the matter
being of some importance, he complies. "It must be
so then," you exclaim, "though I <i>cannot</i> understand
it.".... I only wish that men would be as fair to
the Evangelists as they are to their friends!</p>

<p>You are requested to observe,&mdash;for really you <i>must</i>
admit,&mdash;that <i>any</i> possible solution of a difficulty, however
<i>improbable</i> it may seem, any <i>possible</i> explanation
of the story of a competent witness, is enough logically
and morally to exempt that man from the imputation
of an incorrect statement. The illustration
which first presents itself may require an apology;
but the dignity of the pulpit shall not outweigh the
dignity of <i>His</i> Gospel after whose blessed Name this
House is called<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>: and I can think of nothing as apposite
as what follows.</p>

<p>It is a conceivable case, that, hereafter, three persons
of known truthfulness should meet, in a Court
of Justice at the Antipodes; where the entire difficulty
should turn on a question of time. The case is conceivable,
that the first should be heard to declare that
at Oxford, on such a day, of such a year, he had seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>such an one standing before Carfax Church while the
clock <i>was striking one</i>:&mdash;that the second should declare
that he also, on the same day of the same year, had
seen the same person passing by St. Mary's, when the
clock of <i>that</i> Church was also striking one:&mdash;that the
third should stand up and assert,&mdash;"I also saw the
same person on that same day, but it was on the steps
<i>of the Cathedral</i> I met him; and I also remember
hearing the clock at that moment strike one."&mdash;Now
I can conceive that the result of such evidence would
be adverted upon in some such way as the following:&mdash;"While
we are disposed to recognize the substantial
agreement, and general conformity in respect
of details, among the synoptical witnesses, in their
leading external outlines, we are yet constrained,"&mdash;and
the rest of the impertinence we had before.
Whereas you and I know perfectly that the three
clocks in question were, till lately, <i>kept five minutes
apart</i>: a sufficient interval, (I beg you to observe in
passing,) for the individual in question to have been
seen <i>by you</i> walking in an easterly direction; and <i>by
me</i> due west; and by a third person, due east again.
Highly improbable circumstances, I freely grant,
every one of them; and yet, by the hypothesis, all
perfectly <i>true</i>! Meantime, it is conceivable that
Judge and jury would have the indecency openly to
tax the three men I spoke of with inexactitude in
their statements: and it is conceivable that those
three honest men&mdash;(the <i>only</i> true men, it might be,
in the Colony, after all,)&mdash;would carry to their grave
the imputation of untruth. Here and there, a generous
heart would be found to say to them,&mdash;<i>I</i> share
not in the vulgar cry against you! <i>I</i> nothing doubt
that it all fell out precisely as you assert. Either,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>the clocks in Oxford went wrong that day;&mdash;or there
had been some trick played with the clocks;&mdash;any
how, <i>I</i> believe <i>you</i>, for I have evidence that you are
marvellously exact in all your little statements; and
you cannot have been mistaken in a plain matter
like this. I have heard too that you are not the
ordinary men you seem.... The men make no
answer. <i>They</i> care nothing for <i>your opinion</i>, and <i>my
opinion</i>. The rashness of mankind may astonish the
Angels perhaps; but the Apostles and Evangelists of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> are already safe within the veil!</p>

<p>The difficulty supposed is not an imaginary one.
St. John says that when Pilate sat in judgment on
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of Glory, "it was about the sixth hour<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>."
But since St. Mark says that at the third hour they
crucified Him<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>,&mdash;the two statements seem inconsistent.
The ancients,&mdash;(giants at interpretation, babes
in criticism,)&mdash;<i>altered the text</i>. Peter, Bishop of Alexandria,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 300, says that he had seen it in the very
autograph of St. John<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>. A learned man of our own,
however, a hundred years ago, ascertained that, in the
Patriarchate of Ephesus, the hours were not computed
after the Jewish method: but, (strange to say,)
exactly <i>after our own English method</i><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. And yet, not
so strange either; for the Gospel first came to us
from there.&mdash;You see at a glance that all the four
mentions of time of day in St. John<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>, which used to
occasion so much difficulty, become beautifully intelligible
at once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
To come then to the three samples of difficulty
propounded a moment ago. And first, for the blind
men of Jericho.</p>

<p>I. The difficulty lies all on the surface. Listen
to a plain tale.</p>

<p>Our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, attended by His Disciples and followed
by a vast concourse of persons, had reached
the outskirts of Jericho. A certain blind man was
sitting by the roadside begging. He heard the noise
of a passing crowd, and inquired what it meant? He
was told that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
He rose at once,&mdash;hastened down the main street
through which, in due time, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> perforce must
come; joined another blind man, (named Bartim&aelig;us,&mdash;a
well-known character, who, like himself, was accustomed
to sit and beg by the road side;) and the
two companions in suffering, having stationed themselves
at the exit of Jericho, waited till the Great
Physician should appear.</p>

<p>The crowd begins to approach; and the two blind
men implore the Son of David to have pity on them.
So importunate is their suit, that the foremost of the
passers-by rebuke them. The men grow more urgent.
Our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> pauses, and orders that they shall be
called. At this gracious summons, both draw near;
the more remarkable applicant flinging his outer garment
from him as he rises from his seat; but both,
when they appear in our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> presence, making
the same request. The Holy One, touched with compassion,
laid His Hands upon their eyes, and grants
their prayer: whereupon they both follow Him in
the way.</p>

<p>Well, (you will ask,)&mdash;what then?&mdash;"What then?"
I answer. <i>Then</i> there is no difficulty in the three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>accounts about which you spoke so unbecomingly a
moment ago. Assume this plain, and not at all improbable
version of the incident, to be true, and you
will find that no difficulty remains whatever. Every
recorded circumstance is accounted for, and fits in
exactly with it. I wish there were time to enlarge
on some of the details, and to make some remarks on
the manner of the Evangelists in relating events: but
there <i>is</i> no time. Besides,&mdash;without a huge copy of
the Gospel open before us all, I could not hope to
make my meaning understood.</p>

<p>For of course you are to believe that he who would
understand the Gospel must first <i>study</i> it. You must
ascertain, by some crucial test, confirmed by a large
and careful induction, what the character of a narrative
purporting to be inspired, <i>is</i>. You have no right
first to assume exactly <i>what</i> Inspiration shall result
in, and then to deny that there is Inspiration because
you fail to discover your assumed result<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>. That
were foolish.</p>

<p>I shall perhaps be thought to lay myself open to the
rejoinder,&mdash;"Neither have <i>you</i> any right to assume
that Inspiration will result in Infallibility." But
the retort is without real point. I do but assert that,
just as every man of honour claims to be believed
until he has been convicted of a falsehood,&mdash;inspired
Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles have a right to
our entire confidence in the scrupulous accuracy of
every word they deliver, until it can be <i>shewn</i> that
they have once made a mistake.</p>

<p>If you will take the trouble to compare any of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>cases,&mdash;in Genesis for example,&mdash;where a conversation
is first set down, and then reported by one of the
speakers,&mdash;you will find that it is deemed allowable
to omit or to add clauses, even when the discourse
is related in the first person<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. Something before inserted,
is withheld: or something before withheld, is
inserted. No discourse was probably ever set down,
word for word, as it was delivered. In sacred, as in
profane writings, the exact <i>substance</i>, or rather, the
real <i>purport</i>, of what was spoken, very reasonably
stands for what was <i>actually</i> spoken. The difference
is this;&mdash;that a narrative, by man abridged,
<i>may</i> convey a wrong impression: whereas an inspired
abridgement of any history soever <i>cannot</i> mislead.</p>

<p>Other characteristics of an inspired narrative,&mdash;the
lesser Laws of the Divine Harmony, as they may be
called,&mdash;will be discovered by the attentive reader.
For example, that intervening circumstances are often
passed over, without any notice taken of them whatever:
while yet it is singular how often the Evangelist
shews himself conscious of what he omits by
some very minute allusion to it<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. This must suffice
however. It would require a whole sermon, a whole
volume rather, to enumerate all the features of the
Evangelical method.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
II. The next sample of difficulty will not occupy
us long. St. Matthew is charged with a bad memory,
because he ascribes to "Jeremy the prophet<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>" words
which are said to be found in Zechariah.&mdash;Strange
that men should be heard to differ about a plain matter
of fact! <i>I</i> have never been able to find these
words in Zechariah yet!... There are words <i>something
like them</i>,&mdash;but not those very words, by any
means,&mdash;in Zech. xi. 12. Why then is St. Matthew
to be taxed with a bad memory? Are there
not other prophecies quoted in the New Testament
not to be found in the Old? Yes<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. Is not the self-same
prophecy sometimes found in two different prophets,&mdash;as
in Isaiah and Nahum? Yes<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. Are not
some prophetic passages <i>common to Jeremiah and Zechariah?</i>
Yes<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. The Jews even had a saying that the
Spirit of the one was in the other. <i>Where</i> then remains
a pretence for supposing that St. Matthew was
troubled with a bad memory?</p>

<p>III. So, it is generally assumed that St. Luke made
a mistake when he said that the census of the Nativity
was made when Cyrenius was President of Syria,&mdash;because
not Cyrenius but <i>Varus</i> is known to have
been President about that time.&mdash;Now, there are
three fair conjectures,&mdash;each of which is sufficient to
meet this difficulty: but instead of developing them,
I will simply remind you of a minute circumstance
in Jewish story which shews how dangerous it is to
press a general fact against a particular statement.&mdash;In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>the year 4 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Matthias was undeniably the Jewish
High-priest. Now, if St. Luke, describing the events
of a certain day in September, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 4, had recorded
that the High-priest's name was <i>Joseph</i>, you would
have thought him guilty of a misstatement: but the
error would have been all your own,&mdash;for it has been
discovered that a person bearing that name held the
office of High-priest for <i>one single day</i>,&mdash;namely, the
10th of Tisri.... "A very unlikely circumstance!"
you will exclaim. O yes,&mdash;<i>a very unlikely circumstance
indeed</i>: but, you will have the kindness to observe
that <i>that</i> is not exactly the point in question.</p>

<p>Why then are difficulties of this, or of any kind,
permitted in the Gospel at all? it may be asked.&mdash;I
answer,&mdash;that they may prove instruments of probation
to you and to me. The sensualist has <i>his</i> trials;
and the ambitious man, <i>his</i>. The difficulties in Holy
Scripture,&mdash;which are numerous, and diverse, and
considerable,&mdash;are admirable tests of the moral, the
spiritual, the intellectual temper of Man<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. Experience
shews moreover that some of the minutest
discrepancies of all, if they be but of a character almost
hopeless, are more potent to create perplexity
in minds of a certain constitution, than the gravest
doubts which ever burthened the soul of Speculation.</p>

<p>I have confined myself to one class of objections,
for an obvious reason. Difficulties which arise out
of the <i>matter</i> of Scripture, as it is emphatically embodied
in quotations from the Old Testament made in
the New, must be separately considered in one or
more Sermons on <i>Interpretation</i>. I must be content
to-day with repudiating, in the most unqualified way,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>the notion that a mistake of <i>any kind whatever</i> is consistent
with the texture of a narrative inspired by the
Holy Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>. The allusion in St.&nbsp;Stephen's
speech to "the sepulchre that Abraham bought for
a sum of money of the sons of Emmor, the son" (not
<i>the father</i>, but <i>the son</i>) "of Sychem," is a good example
of confusion apparently existing in an inspired
speaker; but, in reality, only in the writings of those
who have sat in judgment upon his words<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>.</p>

<p>To keep to the case of the Evangelists,&mdash;I appeal
to your sense of fairness, whether it be not reasonable
to assume, that until those blessed writers have been
convicted of <i>one</i> single inaccuracy of statement, their
narratives ought to be accounted faultless, like Him
whose Life they record;&mdash;like Him by whose Spirit they
are inspired. I would to Heaven that men would have
the decency to suspect themselves, and one another,
rather than the Evangelists,&mdash;of mistake; or at least,
before they venture publicly to impugn the Authors
of the Everlasting Gospel, that they would be at the
pains to weigh the evidence with the care <i>that</i> evidence
deserves, but which I am <i>sure</i> that sermon-writers
and essayists do not bestow. Let them spend
the long summer days of many a Long Vacation&mdash;from
early morning until twilight,&mdash;dissecting every
syllable of the blessed pages; and then they will
learn to adore instead of to cavil. They will deem
them absolutely faultless, instead of daring to charge
all their own pitiful misconceptions, and weak misapprehensions,
and miserable blunders, upon <i>them</i>.&mdash;They
will be inclined, rather, to challenge the
world to establish one blot in what they love so well;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>and would gladly stake all upon the issue of a conflict
before a fair tribunal,&mdash;if submission might follow
upon defeat.</p>

<p>As for mistakes of the paltry kind last noticed&mdash;(the
days of Abiathar, the sixteenth of Tiberius, and
so forth,)&mdash;I wonder the glaring absurdity of charging
them against Evangelists, does not strike any modest
man of sane mind. To suppose that St. Matthew
quoted the wrong prophet, or that St. Luke did not
know the regnal years of the reigning Emperor; that
St.&nbsp;Stephen confused Abraham with Jacob, and Sychem
with Hebron;&mdash;all this is really so <i>grossly</i> absurd,
that I can hardly condescend to discuss the question.
It is like maintaining that Sir Isaac Newton, after
discovering the Law of Gravitation, and calculating
the pathway of a planet, persisted in saying that two
and two make five: or that Columbus, after discovering
America, despaired of finding the way to his own
door. It is simply ridiculous!&mdash;Admirable as a subject
for men to exercise their wits upon,&mdash;as instruments
of <i>cavil</i>, objections like these are about as
formidable as a child's sword of lathe in the day
of battle.</p>

<p>I hear some one say,&mdash;It seems to trouble <i>you</i> very
much that inspired writers should be thought capable
of making mistakes; but it does not trouble <i>me</i>,&mdash;Very
likely not. It does not trouble <i>you</i>, perhaps, to see
stone after stone, buttress after buttress, foundation
after foundation, removed from the walls of Zion, until
the whole structure trembles and totters, and is pronounced
insecure. Your boasted unconcern is very
little to the purpose, unless we may also know how
dear to you the safety of Zion is. But if you make
indignant answer,&mdash;(as would to Heaven you may!)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&mdash;that
your care for <span class="smcap">God's</span> honour, your jealousy for
God's oracles, is every whit as great as our own,&mdash;<i>then</i>
we tell you that, on <i>your</i> wretched premises, men
more logical than yourself will make shipwreck of
their peace, and endanger their very souls. There
is no stopping,&mdash;no knowing where to stop,&mdash;in this
downward course. Once admit the principle of fallibility
into the inspired Word, and the whole becomes
a bruised and rotten reed. If St. Paul a little, why
not St. Paul much? If Moses in some places, why
not in many? You will doubt our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> infallibility
next!... It might not trouble <i>you</i>, to find your own
familiar friend telling you a lie, every now and then:
but I trust this whole congregation will share the
preacher's infirmity, while he confesses that it would
trouble <i>him</i> so exceedingly that after one established
falsehood, he would feel unable ever to trust that
friend implicitly again.</p>

<p>Do you mean to say then, (I shall be asked,) that
you maintain the theory of Verbal Inspiration?&mdash;I
answer, I refuse to accept any <i>theory</i> whatsoever<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>.
But I believe that the Bible is the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;and
I believe that <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word must be absolutely
infallible. I shall therefore believe the Bible to
be absolutely infallible,&mdash;until I am convinced of
the contrary. "<i>Theories of Inspiration</i>," (as they are
called,) are the growth of an unbelieving age: and
it is enough to disgust any one with the term, to find
how it has been understood in some quarters. A well-known
living editor of the Gospel<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>, says,&mdash;"According
to the Verbal-Inspiration Theory, each Evangelist
has recorded the exact words of the Inscription on the
Cross;&mdash;not <i>the general sense</i>, but <i>the Inscription itself</i>;&mdash;not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>a letter less nor more. This is absolutely necessary
to the theory." The advocates of the theory
(he proceeds) "may here find an <i>undoubted</i> example
of the absurdity of their view.... Let us bear this
in mind when the narrative of words spoken, or of
events, differs in a similar manner."&mdash;It is certainly
very kind of the learned writer thus to apprize us of
the danger of accepting a theory, which, so explained,
we certainly never heard of before,&mdash;and trust we
may never hear of again.</p>

<p>But if, instead of the "Theory of Verbal Inspiration,"
I am asked whether I believe <i>the words</i> of
the Bible to be inspired,&mdash;I answer, To be sure I do,&mdash;every
one of them: and every syllable likewise. Do
not <i>you?</i>&mdash;<i>Where</i>,&mdash;(if it be a fair question,)&mdash;Where
do you, in your wisdom, stop? The <i>book</i>, you allow
<i>is</i> inspired. How about the chapters? How about
the verses? Do you stop at the verses, and not go
on to the words? Or perhaps you enjoy a special
tradition on this subject, and hold that Inspiration is
a general, vague kind of thing,&mdash;here more, there
less: strong, (to speak plainly,) where you make no
objection to what is stated,&mdash;weak, when it runs
counter to some fancy of your own.&mdash;O Sir, but this
"general vague kind of thing" will not suffice to
anchor the fainting soul upon, in the day of trouble,
and in the hour of death! "Here <i>more</i>, there <i>less</i>,"
will not satisfy a parched and weary spirit, athirst
for the water of Life, and craving the shadow of the
great Rock. What security can <i>you</i> offer <i>me</i>, that
the promise which has sustained me so long occurs
in the "more," and not in the "less?" How am
I to know that your Bible is <i>my</i> Bible: in other
words, what proof is there that either of us possesses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;the authentic utterance of <span class="smcap">God's
Holy Spirit</span>,&mdash;<i>at all</i>?</p>

<p>And do you not feel, that this "will o' the wisp"
phantom of your brain, can prove no guide to either
of us in the pilgrimage of life? Perceive you not that
the unworthy spirit in which you approach the Book
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Law must effectually prevent you from getting
any wisdom from it? Why, the pages which you
look so coldly and carnally at, are written within and
without, and burn from end to end with unutterable
meaning! While you are quarrelling about the title
on the Cross, you are missing the common salvation!
You keep us, Sunday after Sunday, disputing outside
the gates of Paradise, instead of bidding us enter in,
and eat of the delicious fruit! While <i>you</i> are persisting
that there is no beauty in the garden, (because
you choose to be deaf as well as blind,)&mdash;the shadows
are lengthening out, and the glory is departing, and
the angels are getting weary of harping upon their
harps!</p>

<p>No, Sirs! The Bible (be persuaded) is the very
utterance of the Eternal;&mdash;as much <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word, as
if high Heaven were open, and we heard <span class="smcap">God</span> speaking
to us with human voice. Every book of it, is
inspired alike; and is inspired entirely. Inspiration
is not a difference of degree, but of kind. The Apocryphal
books are not one atom more inspired than
Bacon's Essays. But the Bible, from the Alpha to
the Omega of it, is filled to overflowing with the
Holy Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>: the Books of it, and the sentences
of it, and the words of it, and the syllables of it,&mdash;aye,
and the very letters of it. "Nihil in Scripturis est
otiosum," (said the great Casaubon): "non dictio, non
dictionis forma, non syllaba, non littera." ... The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>difficulty which attends quotations, I must explain
another day. It is <i>not</i> a difficulty.&mdash;The seeming
paradox of calling a pedigree inspired, is only seeming.&mdash;The
<i>text</i> of Holy Scripture has nothing at all to
do with the question. Is a dead poet responsible for
the clumsiness of him who transcribes his copy, or
for the carelessness of the apprentice in the printer's
attic?&mdash;Least of all do we overlook the personality of
the human writers, when we so speak. The styles
of Daniel,&mdash;of St. John,&mdash;of St. Paul,&mdash;of St. James,&mdash;differ
as much as the sounds emitted by organ pipes
of wholly diverse construction. But those human
instruments were fabricated, one and all, by the Hands
of the same Divine Artist: and I have yet to learn
that when the same man builds an organ, fills it with
breath, and performs upon it a piece of his own composition
with matchless skill,&mdash;I have yet to learn
that any part of the honour, any part of the praise,
any part of the glory of the performance is to be withheld
from <i>him!</i> ... The illustration is at least as old
as Christianity itself. Pray take it in the noble words
of Hooker.&mdash;"They neither spoke nor wrote one word
of their own: but uttered syllable by syllable as the
Spirit put it into their mouths; no otherwise than
the harp or the lute doth give a sound according to
the discretion of his hands that holdeth and striketh
it with skill. The difference is only this: an instrument,
whether it be pipe or harp, maketh a distinction
in the times and sounds, which distinction is well
perceived of the hearer, the instrument itself understanding
not what is piped or harped. The prophets
and holy men of <span class="smcap">God</span> not so. 'I opened my mouth,'
saith Ezekiel, 'and <span class="smcap">God</span> reached me a scroll, saying,
Son of Man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>with this I give thee. I ate it, and it was sweet
in my mouth as honey,' saith the prophet<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>. Yea,
sweeter, I am persuaded, than either honey or the
honeycomb. For herein, they were not like harps or
lutes, but they felt, they felt the power and strength
of their own words. When they spake of our peace,
every corner of their hearts was filled with joy. When
they prophesied of mourning, lamentations, and woes,
to fall upon us, they wept in the bitterness and indignation
of spirit, the Arm of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> being mighty
and strong upon them<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>."</p>

<p>To conclude. The first time I enjoyed this privilege,
I urged the younger men to a diligent and
painful daily study of the Bible. On the next occasion,
opening the Bible at the first page, I attempted
to define the provinces of Theological and of Physical
Science. All that was then offered may be summed
up in one brief formula:&mdash;<i><span class="smcap">God's</span> works <span class="smcap">cannot</span> contradict
<span class="smcap">God's</span> Word</i>. I adverted to the method of would-be
geologists, (a class all apart from the grave and
learned few who give their days and nights to a truly
noble branch of study,)&mdash;because from <i>them</i> the most
malignant attacks have proceeded: and I took my
stand on the first chapter of Genesis, because the
enemies of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Truth have made that chapter their
favourite point of attack. But my argument was not
directed more against Geology than against any other
of the physical Sciences. They are all alike the handmaids
of <i>Theological</i> Science. Geology, however, singularly
honoured by the Creator in that He hath bequeathed
for her inspection so many marvels of prim&aelig;val
Time,&mdash;evidences of how He was working in this
remote planet before the Creation of Man;&mdash;Geology,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>I say, it especially behoves to be humble: partly,
because she is the youngest of all the sciences; and
partly, because the weak guesses of her childhood are
yet in the memory of us all. If indeed she would
<i>inherit the Earth</i>, let her remember that she asks for
the blessing which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hath promised to none but
<i>the meek</i><a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>.</p>

<p>We altogether repudiated, then, the contrast which
is often implied between Theology and Science; as if
Theology were <i>not</i> a Science, but some other thing.
Theological Science we declared to be the noblest of
the Sciences,&mdash;the very Queen and Mistress of them
all. And yet, supreme as she is, she not only admits,
but desires, and thankfully accepts the ministerial
offices of the other Sciences; all of which, like dutiful
servants in a household, have it in their power to
render her most important acts of homage. Language,
for example, carries the keys of the casket wherein
she keeps her treasures; and for that reason Theology
hath promoted Language to great honour. History,
and Geography, and Chronology, have each had their
respective tasks assigned them. It is for Astronomy
to make answer if question be raised of the date of
Paschal full Moon, or of Eclipse. Let the physiologist
explain, if he can, Scriptural allusions to the
vegetable and animal kingdoms. How precious are
the guesses of Geology, as she tries to fathom the
Ocean of unrecorded Time!&mdash;<i>Who</i> would desire the
silence of the Professor of <i>any</i> department of physical
Science? Morals also have their place and their
function assigned them; and a thrice blessed place,&mdash;a
most holy function is theirs! Why should not
Moral Science have an office even in the Court of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Theology? Was not Morality the Schoolmaster of
the sons of Japheth, what time there was dew on the
fleece only, but it was dry upon all the earth beside?
What are Morals else but the echoes of the voice of
<span class="smcap">God</span> yet lingering in the Hall of Conscience, or
rather in the Chambers of Memory?.... Her function
therefore is to bear willing witness to the Goodness,
the Wisdom, the Justice of the Eternal: and
her place,&mdash;the loftiest which can be imagined for
a creature,&mdash;is somewhere beneath the footstool of
Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>But when, instead of the submissive manners of
a well-ordered Court, symptoms of insolence and insubordination
are witnessed on every side,&mdash;then,
the least and humblest takes leave, (time, and place,
and occasion serving,) to speak out fearlessly on behalf
of that which he loves with an unworthy, but
a most undivided heart.&mdash;When Language impugns
those Oracles which she was hired to decypher,&mdash;and
pretends to doubt the Inspiration of that Book of
which, confessedly, she barely understands the Grammar:&mdash;when
History and Chronology cry out that
the annals of Theology are false, and her record of
Time a fable; that the Deluge, for instance, is an old
wives' story, and the economy of times and seasons
a human fabrication:&mdash;when Astronomical and Mechanical
Science strut up to the Throne whereon sits
the Ancient of Days,&mdash;prate to <i>Him</i>, (the first Author
of Law,) about the "supremacy of Law,"&mdash;and tell
Him to His face that His miracles are things impossible:&mdash;when
Physiology insinuates that Mankind
cannot be descended from one prim&aelig;val pair;
and that the lives of the Patriarchs cannot be such
as they are recorded to have been:&mdash;when the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>tender
to Natural Philosophy gravely assures us that
we ought not to pray for fair weather, because the
weather depends <i>not</i> upon "arbitrary changes in the
will of <span class="smcap">God</span>," <i>but</i> upon laws as fixed and certain "as
the laws of gravitation<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>,"&mdash;which, mark you, Sirs, is
no longer a dry verbal speculation, but is nothing
less than an invasion of that inner chamber where you
or I have retired to pour out the fulness of an aching
heart, in prayer that <span class="smcap">God</span> would prolong, if it may be,
the life of the dearest thing we have on earth; and
rudely to bid us rise from our knees and be silent,
for that the health of Man depends not on the will
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, but on fixed physiological laws:&mdash;lastly, when
the pretender to Geological skill denies the authenticity
of the First Chapter of Genesis; which is to
deny the Inspiration of all the rest; and therefore
of the whole Bible;&mdash;and thus to rob Life's weary
pilgrim of that rod and staff concerning which he
has many a time exclaimed,&mdash;"they <i>comfort</i> me!":&mdash;whenever,
as now, such things are spoken and printed,&mdash;not
in a corner, and by insignificant persons, and
in ambiguous language,&mdash;but in plain English, by
clergymen and scholars in authority, openly in the
face of <span class="smcap">God's</span> sun;&mdash;then it is high time, even for the
humblest and least among you,&mdash;if no man of mark
will speak up, and speak out, for <span class="smcap">God's</span> Truth,&mdash;to
deliver a plain message with that freedom which
Englishmen hold to be a part of their birthright. It
should breed no offence, I say, if the most unworthy
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> servants, here, before you all,&mdash;before these
younger men especially, who have been drawn hither
by the fame of your piety and your learning,&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>who have been entrusted to your guardianship through
the precious years of early manhood, with a well-grounded
confidence that you would give them to
eat not only of the Tree of Knowledge, but also largely
of the fruit of the Tree of Life:&mdash;in this Holy House
too where he received his commission<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, and vowed
before <span class="smcap">God</span> and Man, that he would "be ready," (the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> being his helper,) "with all faithful diligence
to drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines
contrary to <span class="smcap">God</span>'s Word:"&mdash;before <i>such</i> an audience,
and in such a place, it must and <i>shall</i> be lawful for
me solemnly to denounce as false and deadly,&mdash;full
of nothing but pernicious consequence,&mdash;that system
of practical Infidelity which enjoys such unhappy
popularity at this hour; which, under the mask of
Science, and under the specious name of Progress, is
spreading like a fatal contagion through the length
and breadth of the land; and which, if suffered to go
unchastised and unchecked, will end by shaking both
the Altar and the Throne!.... Look well to it, Sirs,
if you care for the safety of the Ark of <span class="smcap">God</span>. For my
part,&mdash;like one of old time whose words I am not
worthy to take upon my lips,&mdash;"I cannot hold my
peace: because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound
of the trumpet, the alarm of war<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>!"</p>

<p>The case is not altered,&mdash;rather is it made worse,&mdash;if
this hostility to <span class="smcap">God</span>'s Truth proceeds from persons
bearing Orders in the English Church. ("O my soul,
come not thou into their secret!") The case is not
altered: for the requirements of Physical Science are
still the plea; and <i>Divines</i>, in <i>no</i> sense, these men are,
however unsuccessful they may prove in establishing
their claim to the title of <i>philosophers</i> either. Nay,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Sirs,&mdash;suffer one of yourselves to ask you, whether
these disgraceful developments are not the lawful result
of your own incredible system, of sending forth,
year by year, men to be teachers and professors of
Divinity,&mdash;to whom you have yet never imparted <i>any
Theological training whatever</i><a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.</p>

<p>You are requested to observe, that not only cannot
<span class="smcap">God</span>'s Works contradict <span class="smcap">God</span>'s Word,&mdash;simply because
they are twin utterances of one and the same Divine
Intelligence;&mdash;but also the deductions of Physical
Science cannot possibly run counter to the decrees of
Theology<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>,&mdash;simply because they are respectively in
a wholly diverse subject-matter. Had Theology even
<i>once</i> delivered a Geological decree, or pretended even
<i>once</i> to pronounce upon any Astronomical problem;
then, indeed, there would be reason why her disciples
should watch with alarm the rapid advance of Physical
Science,&mdash;instead of hailing it, as they do, with wonder
and delight. Then, indeed, we should be constrained
to admit that the day might be coming when Theology
would have to reconsider the platform whereon
she stands; and possibly to "give way." But
it is an undeniable fact that there exist <i>no</i> Theological
dogmas on matters Geological,&mdash;no, <i>not one!</i>
Theology cannot retreat from ground on which she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>has never set foot. She cannot retract, what she has
never advanced, or recal the words which she has
never spoken. The decrees of Theology are all confined
to the Science of Theology,&mdash;and with <i>that</i> subject-matter,
the other Sciences have simply <i>no concern</i>.
Their office <i>there</i>, as I have again and again explained,
is simply ministerial; and when they enter the presence
chamber of the great King, they are bid not to
draw too nigh. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet;
for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground!"</p>

<p>And how about Moral Science,&mdash;whom we beheld,
a moment since, shrouded in her mantle, beneath the
footstool of the <span class="smcap">Almighty</span>;&mdash;afraid to look up into
His awful Face,&mdash;and not presuming to speak, unless
called upon to bear her solemn witness to what
she learned of Him "in the beginning?"&mdash;Must we
imagine <i>her</i> too rising from her lowly seat, and presuming
to sit in judgment upon the Author of her
Being? Are we to picture her arraigning the Goodness
of Him who commanded Abraham to slay his
son;&mdash;or the Justice of Him who sent Saul to destroy
the Amalekites;&mdash;or the Mercy of Him who inspired
certain of David's Psalms;&mdash;or the Wisdom of Him
who made the everlasting Gospel the mysterious four-fold
thing it is?&mdash;Then, were she to do so, we should
perforce exclaim,&mdash;This judgment of thine cannot
possibly be just! For the echo <i>must</i> resemble the
voice which woke it! Other spirits must have been
intruding here; and the unholy din of their voices
must have drowned the clear, yet still and small
utterance of <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span> within thy breast!....
In other words, if there <i>be</i> antagonism, Ethics,&mdash;not
Theology, <i>but</i> (<i>that which calls itself</i>) <i>Moral Science</i>,&mdash;must
instantly and hopelessly give way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
For doubtless, that inference of ours as to what had
happened, would be a true inference.&mdash;It <i>will</i> be the
fact, I fear, before the end of all things; for it seems
to be implied,&mdash;(a more heart-sickening sentence in
all Scripture, I know not!),&mdash;that when the Son of
Man cometh, He will not find the Faith on the Earth<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>.
And if not <i>the Faith</i> (&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;),&mdash;what then? <i>The
Moral Sense?</i> Hardly! for where was the Moral Sense
when she <i>let go</i> the Faith?&mdash;It was the fact, (if I read
the record rightly,) eighteen centuries ago: for children
had then forgotten their duty to their Parents;
and the sanctity of Marriage was unknown; and (O
prime note of a darkened conscience!) men not only
<i>did</i> things worthy of Death, but "<i>had pleasure in them
that did them</i>." Read the first chapter of St. Paul's
Epistle to the Romans, and say what was <i>then</i> the
condition of the Moral Sense in man. Tell me, while
your cheek is yet burning, whether you think Moral
Science was <i>then</i> competent to sit in judgment on a
Revelation sent from the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Purity, until <span class="smcap">God</span>'s
own <span class="smcap">Son</span> had republished the sanctions of the Moral
Law, and informed Man's conscience afresh!... No
Sirs. We are told expressly, that "as they did not
like to retain <span class="smcap">God</span> in their knowledge, <span class="smcap">God</span> gave them
over to a reprobate mind,"&mdash;"gave them up unto vile
affections." And why? Hear the Apostle! It was
because "when they knew <span class="smcap">God</span>, they glorified Him
not as <span class="smcap">God</span>; neither were thankful:"&mdash;hence, they
were suffered to become vain in their imaginations,
and, "<i>their foolish heart was darkened!</i>"&mdash;In other
words, the candle of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the light of conscience
within them, was well nigh <i>put out</i>.</p>

<p>This will explain the reason why, when "<span class="smcap">THE
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Word</span> was made flesh and dwelt among us," He so
frequently delivered precepts,&mdash;yea, preached whole
Sermons,&mdash;on what would now-a-days be called mere
"Morality." He was <i>republishing the Moral Law</i>. He
was graving afresh those letters which had been wellnigh
worn out through tract of Time, and the wear
and tear of Man's ungoverned lusts.&mdash;Hence, to this
hour, when question is raised of Right and Wrong,&mdash;the
appeal is made, by the common consent of Christian
men, <i>not</i> to the inner consciousness of the creature,
but to the Creator's external Revelation of His mind
and will. Let abler men explain to us what we mean
when we talk about Immutable Morality. I am by
no means sure that I understand myself. Sure only
am I that it will carry us a very little way. Aristotle
would never have made the average moral sense of
mankind his standard, had <i>he</i> known of a &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;.
The principles of Morality do indeed seem
to be fixed and eternal;&mdash;&#7936;&#949;&#8055; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#949; &#950;&#8135; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;:&mdash;but it
is no longer true, &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#959;&#7990;&#948;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#958; &#8005;&#964;&#959;&#965; '&#966;&#8049;&#957;&#951;. Ever
since the Gospel came into the world, <i>general opinion</i>
has ceased to be the standard of Truth: for the Bible
has simply superseded it; and put forth a standard to
which "general opinion" itself must bow. "<i>I</i> am
the Way, <i>the Truth</i>, and the Life." So spake the
Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span> while yet on Earth. And He foresaw
that there would come a day when the world would
still ask, with Pilate, "What is Truth?" Accordingly,
we heard his solemn reply in this Morning's Second
Lesson&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Thy Word</span>,"&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Thy Word</span> is Truth." ...
"<span class="smcap">God</span> made two great lights," I grant you: but what
I maintain is, that He made "<i>the greater Light</i> to
rule <i>the Day</i>."</p>

<p>And therefore are we very bold to assert that it is all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>too late for men <i>now</i> to vaunt the authority of the Moral
Sense, as a thing to be set up against the fixed and
immutable Revelation of <span class="smcap">God's</span> mind and will. "The
sufficiency of Natural Religion is a paradox of modern
invention, and the boast of it comes with an ill grace,
and under great suspicions, so late in the day of
trial<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>." Aye, it comes all too late. Here in England,
(<span class="smcap">God</span> be praised!) the moral sense is indeed strong.
Is it <i>as</i> strong, think you, among those continental nations
which are under the spiritual yoke of Rome? Is
it as strong among the Hindoos? Is it as strong among
the savage inhabitants of central Australia?... Perceive
you not that if Moral Science speaks with a loud
and clear voice in Christian lands, it is because there
the Moral Sense has been in those lands informed
afresh by Revelation? "That the principles of Natural
Religion have come to be so far understood and
admitted, may fairly be taken for one of the effects of
the Gospel<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>." The echoes of the voice of <span class="smcap">God</span> are
now so distinct, only because <span class="smcap">God</span> hath suffered His
awful voice to be heard on earth again: and if among
ourselves those echoes are the loudest and the clearest,
is it not because among ourselves the Bible is read
the most?</p>

<p>"The fact" (says the thoughtful writer already
quoted,)&mdash;"the fact is not to be denied; the Religion
of Nature <i>has</i> had the opportunity of rekindling her
faded taper by the Gospel light,&mdash;whether furtively
or unconsciously availed of. Let her not dissemble
the obligation, and make a boast of the splendour, as
though it were originally her own; or had always, in
her hands, been sufficient for the illumination of the
World."&mdash;"It is not to be imagined that men fail to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>profit by the light that has been shed upon them,
though they have not always the integrity to own the
source from which it comes; or though they may turn
their back upon it, whilst it fills the very atmosphere
in which they move, with glory<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>."</p>

<p>I say, therefore, that it is <i>all too late</i> to vaunt the
supremacy of Conscience as opposed to Revelation,&mdash;Moral
as opposed to Theological Science. Moral
Science owes all its renewed strength and vigour to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Theology. And so, were Moral Science to dare call in
question, (as she sometimes <i>has</i> done, and may dare
to do again!), the Morality of the Bible,&mdash;we should
find her monstrous image nowhere so fitly as in that
of the man whose withered hand <span class="smcap">Christ</span> healed in
the Synagogue,&mdash;if the same man had proved such a
wretch, as straightway to lift up his arm with intention
to smite his Benefactor and his <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>Physical Science therefore, (for the last time!)&mdash;<i>all</i>
the other Sciences,&mdash;Moral Science not excepted,&mdash;are
the handmaids of Theological Science: and Morality,
to which we omitted before to assign an office,
we have stationed somewhere beneath the footstool,
which is before the Throne, of the Most High.&mdash;But
this day's Sermon,&mdash;(and with these words I conclude,
sorry to have felt obliged to detain you so
long!)&mdash;<i>this</i> Day's Sermon has had for its object
to remind you, that <span class="smcap">the Bible</span> is none other than
<i>the voice of Him that sitteth upon the Throne</i>! Every
Book of it,&mdash;every Chapter of it,&mdash;every Verse of it,&mdash;every
word of it,&mdash;every syllable of it,&mdash;(<i>where</i> are
we to <i>stop</i>?)&mdash;every letter of it&mdash;is the direct utterance
of the Most High!&mdash;&#928;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052; &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;.
"Well spake the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, by the mouth of" the
many blessed Men who wrote it.&mdash;The Bible is none
other than <i>the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>: not some part of it,
more, some part of it, less; but all alike, the utterance
of Him who sitteth upon the Throne;&mdash;absolute,&mdash;faultless,&mdash;unerring,&mdash;supreme!</p>

by the Council of Antioch in the case of Paul of Samosata, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 269.
(Routh <i>Reliqq.</i> iii. 292.) See Middleton <i>on the Greek Article</i>,
(Rose's ed.) <i>in loc.</i> And so, in effect, Wordsworth and Ellicott.&mdash;It
is right to add that it has been contended that &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8053; = "the
whole of Scripture." See Lee <i>on Inspiration</i>, p.&nbsp;263, (note.)
So Athanasius seems to have taken it: &#928;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#7969; &#954;&#945;&#952;' &#7969;&#956;&#8118;&#962; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052;,
&#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#8049; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8052;, &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;. (<i>Ep. ad Marcell.</i> i. 982.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_332_332" id="Footnote_332_332"></a><a href="#FNanchor_332_332"><span class="label">[332]</span></a> That &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; is the predicate, seems sufficiently obvious.
So Athanasius, in the passage above quoted. So Gregory of Nyssa:
&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052; &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#8051;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#7952;&#956;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8059;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;
&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8055;&#945;&#957;. (<i>Contr. Eunom.</i> Orat. VI. ii. 605.) Amphilochius,
Bishop of Iconium, quotes the place in the same way.&mdash;Basil also,
saying&mdash;&#928;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052; &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8032;&#966;&#8051;&#955;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;, &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#945;
&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#928;&#957;&#949;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, (<i>Hom. in Psalm.</i> I. i. 90,)&mdash;clearly adopts the construction
assumed in the text.&mdash;Ambrose (<i>De Spir. Sancto</i>, lib. II.
c. 16. ii. 688,) says,&mdash;"In Scriptura Divina, &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; omnis ex hoc
dicitur, quod Deus inspiret qu&aelig; locutus est Spiritus." (The above
are from Lee <i>on Inspiration</i>, which see, pp.&nbsp;260, 493, 599.)&mdash;Tertullian
(quoted by Tisch.) says, "Legimus omnem Scripturam &aelig;dificationi
habilem, divinitus inspirari."&mdash;A few modern scholars have
suggested that &#952;&#8051;&#959;&#960;&#957;. may be an epithet, not a predicate. The <i>doctrine</i>
will remain the same either way; for the meaning of the place
can only be, "Every Scripture, <i>being</i> inspired, is also <i>profitable</i>," &amp;c.
This is Origen's view: but his criticism is not in point, inasmuch
as he read the text differently, (omitting the &#954;&#945;&#8055;.) Lee aptly compares
the construction of &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#954;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#956;&#945; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957;.

is from Bp. Horsley's <i>Primary Charge to the Clergy of Rochester</i>,
(1796,):&mdash;"The question in this case is not abstract,&mdash;what
Reason <i>may have</i> the ability to do. The question is upon
a matter of fact,&mdash;<i>what she did</i>. Were these things, in point of
fact, man's own discovery?&mdash;The sacred history is explicit that they
were not. And notwithstanding the many useful lessons of Morality
we find in the writings of the heathen sages,&mdash;the many
eloquent discourses upon providence, and the immortality of the
soul,&mdash;the many subtile disquisitions upon the great questions of
necessity and moral freedom, upon fate and chance,&mdash;I am persuaded,
that had it not been for the early communications of the Creator
with mankind, Man never would have raised the conceptions of his
mind to the idea of a God; he never would have dreamt of the immaterial
principle within himself; and he never would have formed
any general notions of Right and Wrong in the abstract; he would
have had no Religion, perhaps no Morality.... The prudent dispensers
of the Word will resort to Revelation for his first principles,
as well as for more mysterious truths. He will not trust to philosophy
for any discoveries. He will suffer philosophy to be nothing
more than his assistant in the study of the inspired Word. She
must herself be instructed by those lively oracles before she can be
qualified to take part in the instruction of men. To lay the foundation
of Revelation upon any previous discoveries of Reason, is in
fact to make Reason the superior teacher. It is not improbable,

<p>THE PLENARY INSPIRATION OF EVERY PART OF THE

OF INSPIRATION.&mdash;THE TEXT OF SCRIPTURE.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">St. John</span> xvii. 17.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:2em;"><i>Thy Word is Truth.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I thankfully avail myself of the opportunity
which, unexpected and unsolicited, so soon presents
itself, to proceed with the subject which was
engaging our attention when I last occupied this
place.</p>

<p>Let me remind you of the nature of the present
inquiry, and of the progress which we have already
made.</p>

<p>Taking Holy Scripture for our subject, and urging,
as best we knew how, its paramount claims on the
daily attention of the younger men,&mdash;who at present
are our hope and ornament; to be hereafter, as we
confidently believe, our very crown and joy;&mdash;even
while we held in our hands that volume which our
Fathers were content to call the volume of Inspiration,
we were constrained to recollect that its claim to be
inspired has of late years been repeatedly called in
question. It has even become the fashion to cavil at
almost everything which the Bible contains. We are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>grown so exceedingly wise, have made so many strange
discoveries, and have become so clear-sighted, that
the more advanced among us are kindly bent on disabusing
the minds of their less gifted brethren of that
most venerable delusion of all,&mdash;(for it is coeval with
Christianity,)&mdash;that the Bible is in any special sense
the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>. I do not say that Theologians
talk thus. But pretenders to Natural Science, knowing
nothing whatever of Divinity, and therefore intruding
into a realm of which they do not understand
so much as the language;&mdash;together with, (sad to
relate!) men bearing a commission in the Church of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, (and who ought therefore to be building up,
where they are seeking to destroy,)&mdash;are employing
the powers which <span class="smcap">God</span> has given them, in this direction.
It becomes indispensable, in consequence, that
we should say somewhat on behalf of those Oracles
which have been so vigorously impugned; and it
should not seem strange if we oppose to such destructive
dogmatism, the most uncompromising severity
of counter statement.</p>

<p>The objections which have been raised against the
Bible, although they have been industriously gleaned
from various quarters, will all be most effectually met,
I am persuaded, by getting men to acquaint themselves
with the contents of the deposit itself. And
yet, inasmuch as it is the nature of doubts, when
once injected into the mind, to fester and to spread;
inasmuch also as the bold confidence of plausible assertion,
especially when recommended by men of reputation,
and set off with some ability and skill, is apt
to impose on youth and inexperience;&mdash;we seem reduced
to a kind of necessity, to examine; and, as far
as the limits of a sermon will allow, to refute; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>charges which have been so industriously brought
forward against the Bible.</p>

<p>The favourite objections of the day come partly
from without,&mdash;partly from within. The classification
is not exact, but it may serve to assist the memory.
One class of objections is, in a manner, destructive,&mdash;for
it results in entire disbelief of the Bible:&mdash;the
other class, suggesting imperfections, results in a low
and disparaging estimate of its contents. When exception
is taken against certain portions of Holy Scripture,
on the ground of discoveries in Physical Science,&mdash;of
the dictates of the Moral Sense,&mdash;of the supremacy
of mechanical Laws,&mdash;and the like,&mdash;we consider
that the supposed difficulties come <i>from without</i>. As
much as we care to say on this class of objections has
either been already offered, or must be reserved for
a subsequent occasion<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>.&mdash;When doubts are insinuated,
arising out of the subject-matter of the Bible, we
consider the difficulties to proceed <i>from within</i>. The
apparent contradictions of the Evangelists, are of this
nature. Supposed errors or misstatements, come under
the same head. Very imperfectly, yet sufficiently for
our immediate purpose, we have touched upon both
subjects. Those portions of the Old Testament which
savour in the highest degree of the marvellous, must
be reserved for separate consideration<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>. To-day I propose
to speak of another kind of objection; but which
arises, like the others, out of the subject-matter of the
Bible. Moreover, it is the kind of difficulty which
most readily presents itself to any who listened with
unwilling ears to my last discourse. Some here present
may remember my repeated and unequivocal assertion
that Holy Scripture is inspired from the Alpha
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>to the Omega of it;&mdash;not some parts more, some parts
less, but all equally, and all to overflowing;&mdash;that we
hold it to be, not generally inspired, but particularly;
that we see not how with logical consistency we can
avoid believing the words as well as the sentences of
it; the syllables as well as the words; the letters as
well as the syllables; every "jot" and every "tittle"
of it, (to use our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> expression,) to be divinely
inspired:&mdash;and further, that until the contrary has
been <i>proved</i>, we shall maintain that no misapprehension
or misstatement, no error or blot of any kind,
can possibly exist within its pages:&mdash;that we hold
the Bible to be as much the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, as if <span class="smcap">God</span>
spoke to us therein with human lips;&mdash;and that, as
the very utterance of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, we cannot <i>but</i>
think that it must be absolute, faultless, unerring,
supreme.</p>

<p>I. To this, it has been objected as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>You cannot possibly mean what you say. You will
not pretend to assert that the list of the Dukes of
Edom<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>, is as much inspired,&mdash;inspired in <i>the same
sense</i>,&mdash;as the Gospel of St. John.&mdash;To which I make
answer, that I believe one to be just as much inspired
as the other: and before I leave off, I will endeavour to
bring my hearers to the same opinion. In the meantime,
it is only fair to the objector, to hear him out:
to follow his guidance; and to see whither he would
lead us. It will be quite competent for us <i>then</i> to
retrace our steps; to point out "a more excellent
way;" and to entreat him, with all a brother's earnestness,
to reconsider the matter, and to follow <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>The objection may, I believe, be fairly stated as
follows.&mdash;It is unreasonable to consider any part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Holy Scripture inspired which the author was competent
to write without the aid of Inspiration. Just
as you would not multiply miracles needlessly, and
ascribe to special Divine interference results which
might be otherwise accounted for, so neither ought
you to call in the aid of Inspiration where it may
clearly be dispensed with. A genealogy,&mdash;a catalogue
of names, whether of places or persons,&mdash;whatever
may reasonably be suspected to have been an
extract from public Archives;&mdash;nothing of this sort
need you, nor indeed, properly speaking, <i>can</i> you, call
"inspired." More than that. All mere narratives
of ordinary transactions,&mdash;or indeed of transactions
extraordinary;&mdash;whatever, in short, a writer, having
first beheld it with his eyes, appears to have simply
described with his pen, it is unreasonable to regard
as the work of Inspiration. For it is plain to common
sense,&mdash;(so at least I have heard it said,) that there is
much, both in the Old and in the New Testament, the
delivery of which required no other than the ordinary
gifts of men:&mdash;actual observation, good memory, high
intellect, clearness of statement, honesty of purpose.
Look at the preface to St. Luke's Gospel. It seems
only to convey that the author of it believed himself
to be bringing out a superior edition of a narrative
which had already been attempted by many. I would
apply, (it is said,) to the whole of the Old Testament
the same observations which I apply to the New.
There are parts which evidently required nothing but
opportunity of experience, or research, and the ordinary
qualities of a trustworthy historian.&mdash;This then
is the way the case is put. There is no intentional
irreverence on the part of the objector: no conscious
hostility to <span class="smcap">God's</span> Truth. Very much the reverse.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>But having once assumed that the catalogue of the
Dukes of Edom is not to be regarded as an inspired
document, he has logical consistency enough to perceive
that he cannot exactly stop <i>there</i>. And so, he
carries his speculations a little further. He tries to
take (what he calls) a "common sense" view of the
question. He says that he thinks it a dangerous
proceeding on the part of the preacher to insist on
the infallibility of Apostles and Evangelists. Meanwhile,
I suspect that he is not by any means without
a suspicion that he is on a platform beset with <i>far
greater dangers</i>, himself. He has walked a little this
way, and that way; and his "common sense" has
shewn him that there is an ugly precipice on every
side. Nay; he perceives that the ground trembles,
and cracks, and shakes,&mdash;and even yawns beneath
his feet.</p>

<p>For I request you to observe, that there is absolutely
no middle state between Inspiration and non-inspiration.
If a writing be inspired, it is Divine: if
it be not inspired, it is human. It is absurd to shirk
the alternative. <i>Some</i> parts of the Bible, it is allowed,
<i>are</i> inspired; other parts, it is contended, are <i>not</i>. Let
it be conceded then, for the moment, that the catalogue
of the Dukes of Edom is <i>not</i> an inspired writing;
and let it be ejected from the Bible accordingly.
We must by strict parity of reasoning, eject the xth
chapter of Genesis, which enumerates the descendants
of Japheth, of Ham, and of Shem, with the countries
which they severally occupied,&mdash;that truly venerable
record and outline of the prim&aelig;val settlement of the
nations! The ten Patriarchs before, and the ten
after Noah: the many enumerations contained in the
Book of Numbers: much of the two Books of Chroni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>cles:
together with the Genealogies of our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
as given by St. Matthew and St. Luke.</p>

<p>It is clear that the history of the Flood,&mdash;very
much of it at least,&mdash;is of the same nature: a kind of
calendar as it were, and record of dates.</p>

<p>But we may go on faster, and use the knife far
more freely. Every thing in the Pentateuch of which
Moses had been an eye or ear-witness, and which he
set down from his own personal knowledge, may be
eliminated from the Bible, as not inspired. According
to the principle already enunciated by yourself,
I call upon you to excise from the Book of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Law,
Exodus, and Leviticus, and Numbers, and Deuteronomy:
those passages only excepted which are prophetical,&mdash;as
the xxxiiird of Deuteronomy. Joshua
must go of course: for if the son of Nun did not
write the Book which goes under his name,&mdash;(as the
wise men in Germany say, or used to say, he did
not<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>,)&mdash;of course the narrative is not authentic; and
if he <i>did</i>, <i>you</i> say that it ought not to be regarded as
inspired. Judges and Ruth cannot hope to stand;
for they are mere stories,&mdash;narratives of events which
any contemporary author who enjoyed "actual observation,
good memory, high intellect, clearness of
statement, and honesty of purpose," was abundantly
qualified&mdash;(according to <i>your</i> view of the matter)&mdash;to
commit to writing. The Books of Samuel and of
Kings cannot be claimed as the work of Inspiration,
of course. Chronicles we have got rid of already.
No imaginable plea can be invented for the Books
of Ezra, of Nehemiah, and of Esther; those writings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>having evidently required nothing (to use your own
phrase) but "opportunity of experience or research,
and the ordinary qualities of a trustworthy historian."
The prophetical books you spare; natural piety suggesting
that since "Prophecy came not in old time
by the will of man, but holy men of <span class="smcap">God</span> spake as
they were moved by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span><a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>;"&mdash;the writings
of Isaiah and the rest, must be retained as inspired.
We expunge those portions only which are simply
historical and moral; since to these, by the hypothesis,
the spirit of Inspiration cannot be thought
to have extended.</p>

<p>We come now to the New Testament; and two of
the Gospels are found to be mutilated already, by the
elimination of one chapter of St. Matthew and one of
St. Luke. But on the principle that personal observation,
a good memory, honesty of purpose, and so
forth, are the only requirements necessary, we may
proceed to carry forward the work of excision with
spirit, so that we be but careful to use discernment.
For example, we may begin with the Call of St. Matthew,
and the Feast which he made to our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in
his own house. <i>Who</i> so competent to relate this, as
the Evangelist himself? Whenever, in short, the
Twelve were present, St. Matthew, (as one of the
Twelve,) may be assumed to have written from personal
observation; and <i>that</i> portion of his narrative is
to be rejected accordingly as uninspired.</p>

<p>It is painful to anticipate what will be the fate of
St. John's Gospel, on this principle,&mdash;together with
most of the Divine Discourses therein recorded. Not,
to be sure, that we shall lose the conversation with
Nicodemus, nor that with the woman of Samaria;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>because St. John was not present when either of those
conversations took place: but all, from the xivth to
the xviith chapter inclusive; as well as the discourse
in the vith chapter, must of course be dismissed.
The matter of these discourses, it will be urged,&mdash;(with
more of logical consistency, alas! than of essential
truth,)&mdash;might have been faithfully handed down
by St. John without any extraordinary gift. He was
bound to our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> by more than ordinary affection.
He was ever nearest to Him. Is it not conceivable,
(we are asked,) that these two causes, aided by a retentive
memory, would at least <i>enable</i> him to give us
the record which he has given?</p>

<p>Quite superfluous must it be to state that the Acts
of the Apostles, under the expurgatory process which
now engages our attention, will cease to be regarded
as an inspired Book; and therefore must be at once
disconnected from the confessedly inspired portions of
Holy Scripture.&mdash;St. Paul's Epistles, you say, on the
contrary, are probably inspired, and therefore are
probably to be spared.... And I really think we
need go no further. If your own handling of Holy
Scripture,&mdash;your own method, by yourself applied,&mdash;be
not a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, I know of nothing
in the world which is.... Look only at that handful
of mutilated pages in the hands of one who is
supposed to be the impersonation of "common sense;"
turn the tattered and mangled leaves over and over,
which <i>you</i> are pleased to call the Volume of Inspiration;
and get all the comfort and help out of it you
can. But be not surprised to hear that you are exposing
yourself to the ridicule of the sane part of
Mankind,&mdash;even while haply you are acting a part
which makes the Angels weep.... How much of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>the Bible will remain, when <i>Science</i>, (Physical, Moral,
Historical,) has further done <i>her</i> work, I forbear now
to inquire: but I shrewdly suspect that she will leave
you very little beyond the back and the covers.</p>

<p>Let us not be told, (as we doubtless shall,) that
the human parts of Scripture need not be <i>ejected</i> from
the Canon because they are human: that they may
be allowed to stand with the rest, although uninspired;
and the like. About this, <i>we</i> at least are competent
judges. We are now bent on discovering how much
of Holy Scripture is <i>the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>; and we refuse,
for the moment, to regard as such, and to retain,
a single passage which, being (as you say) uninspired,
is simply <i>the word of Man</i>.</p>

<p>II. Let me now be permitted to lay before you a
somewhat different view of the office of Inspiration.
Since the illumination of Science, falsely so called,
and the process of Common Sense, would seem to
have resulted in the extinction of the deposit, I ask
your patience while I try to shew, that common sense,
informed by a somewhat loftier Theological Instinct,
may give such an account of the matter as will enable
us to preserve every word of the deposit entire.</p>

<p>You call my attention to the catalogue of the
Dukes of Edom, and tell me that it required no
supernatural aid to enable Moses to write it. How,
may I ask, do you ascertain that fact? No specimens
of the documentary evidence of the land of Seir in
the days of Moses, are known now to exist on the
earth's surface. You therefore know absolutely nothing
whatever about the matter of which you speak
so confidently.</p>

<p>But, that we may grapple with the question fairly,
let us come down from an age concerning which nei<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ther
of us knows anything beyond what the Bible
teaches, to a period with which all are familiar, and
to documents of which we know at least a little. It
will suit your purpose far better that you should instance
the two Genealogies of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;of which
you also say that it is impossible to maintain that
they exhibit the work of Inspiration in the same
sense as when some lofty statement of Christian doctrine
comes before us. Indeed, you deny that they
are inspired at all. I, on my side, am willing to
admit that it is quite possible,&mdash;even probable,&mdash;that
the first and the third Evangelist had access to extant
documents of which they respectively availed
themselves, when they recorded our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> descent.</p>

<p>But, do you not perceive that the great underlying
fallacy in all you have been saying, is your own
wholly gratuitous assumption that you are a competent
judge of what <i>did</i>,&mdash;what did <i>not</i>,&mdash;require
supernatural aid to deliver? that whatever <i>seems</i> as
if it might have been written without Inspiration,
<i>was</i> therefore written without it?&mdash;I see so many
practical inconveniences, or rather I see such glaring
absurdity, resulting from the supposition that Inspiration
goes and comes before an authentic document,
that I am constrained to think that you are altogether
mistaken in the office which you assign to Inspiration,&mdash;in
the kind of notion which you seem to entertain
concerning its nature.</p>

<p>An Evangelist, if you please, is inspired. It becomes
necessary to introduce a genealogy. Following
the Divine guidance, (the nature of which, neither
you nor I know anything at all about,) he applies in
a certain quarter, and obtains access to a certain
document. Or he repairs to a well-known repository
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>of public archives, and out of the whole collection he
is guided to make choice of one particular writing.
He proceeds to transcribe it,&mdash;omitting names (dropping
three generations for instance,)&mdash;or inserting
names (the second Cainan for example,)&mdash;or, if you
please, neither omitting nor inserting anything. The
document, (suppose,) requires no correction whatever.&mdash;Well
but, this man was inspired a moment ago, in
what he was writing; and no reason has been shewn
why he should not be inspired still. He has adopted
a document, by incorporating it into his narrative.
By transcribing it, he has made it his own. I
am at a loss to see that its claim to be an inspired
writing, from that moment forward, is in any respect
inferior to the rest of the narrative in which
it stands.</p>

<p>You are requested to remember that when we call
the Bible an inspired book, we mean nothing more
than that the words of it are the very utterance of the
<span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>;&mdash;that the Book is as much the Word of
<span class="smcap">God</span> as if high Heaven were open, and we heard <span class="smcap">God</span>
speaking to us with human voice. All I am contending
for <i>now</i>, is, that this is at least as true of one part
of the Gospel as of another: that if it be true of anything
in the Gospel, it is at least <i>as</i> true of the
Genealogy of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. The <i>subject-matter</i> indeed is
different; but it is a mere confusion of thought to
infer therefrom a different degree of <i>Inspiration</i>. Let
me try and make this plainer by a few familiar illustrations.</p>

<p>1. When the Sovereign reads a speech from the
Throne, does she speak the words of it in any <i>different
sense</i> from the words of a speech which she has herself
composed?&mdash;Nay, are words of investiture, mere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>words of form and state, in any <i>less degree spoken</i>,
than words of confidence, and private friendship?</p>

<p>2. Again. The substance of paper and the substance
of gold, are widely different. And yet, when paper
has been subjected to a certain process, and stamped
with a certain impress, there is practically <i>no difference
whatever</i> between the value of what was, a moment
ago, absolutely worthless, and an ingot of the purest
gold.</p>

<p>3. Consider how the case stands with a merely human
author. An historian has occasion to introduce into
his narrative the descent of a House, or the preamble
of an Act, or any other lifeless thing. Does his responsibility
cease when he comes to it, and recommence
immediately afterwards? Is he not responsible
just to the same extent for <i>that</i>, as for every other
part of his story?</p>

<p>That he did not <i>compose it himself</i>, is certain: but
<i>neither did he compose the sayings which he has recorded
of great men</i>.&mdash;True also is it that the edification to
be derived from the pedigree is not so great,&mdash;certainly,
not so obvious,&mdash;as from certain of the events
which he describes. But it is nevertheless henceforth
an integral part of his history. He sought for it,&mdash;and
he found it: he weighed it,&mdash;and he approved of
it: he transcribed it,&mdash;and he interwove it into his
narrative. In a word, he adopted; and by adopting,
he <i>made it his own</i>. Henceforth, it will be
quoted as authentic, because it is found to have
satisfied <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The utmost praise which can be accorded to any
creature is, that it thoroughly fulfils the office whereunto
God sends it. A genealogy is not intended to
make men wise unto Salvation: the threats and pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>mises
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Law are not intended to acquaint men
with the descent of David's Son. But because <i>their
offices</i> are different, it does not follow that <i>their origin</i>
shall not he the same! Is a shoe-latchet in any sense
less an article manufactured by Man, than a watch?
Is the Archangel Michael, burning with glory, and
intent on some celestial enterprise, with twelve legions
of glittering seraphs in his train;&mdash;is such a host as
<i>that</i>, one atom more a creation of the <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> than
the handful of yellow leaves which flutter unheeded
on the blast?</p>

<p>None of these figures present a strict parallel; and
yet, successively, they seem to set forth different
aspects of the same case, with sufficient vividness
and truth.... So bent am I on conveying to your
minds the strong sense of certainty, the clear definite
view, which I cherish for myself on this subject, that
I take leave to add yet another illustration.</p>

<p>4. If I commission a Servant to deliver a message,&mdash;is
not the message which he delivers <i>mine</i>? If I give
him words to deliver,&mdash;are not <i>the words</i> which he
delivers <i>mine</i>? So obvious a proposition is no matter
of opinion. You <i>cannot</i> deny it. Nor,&mdash;(to apply the
illustration to the matter in hand,)&mdash;nor <i>do</i> you deny
it, probably, so far as <i>Prophecy</i>, (in the popular sense
of the term,) is concerned: but you begin to doubt, it
seems, when any other function of the prophetic office
is in question. "Any other function," I say; for,
(as all men ought to be aware,) a prophet,&mdash;(<i>nav&#275;</i> in
Hebrew, &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962; in Greek,)&mdash;does not, by any means,
of necessity imply one who describes <i>future</i> events.
&#928;&#961;&#8057; does not denote futurity of time, but vicariousness
of office. The &#960;&#961;&#959;-&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962; is one who speaketh &#960;&#961;&#8057;,
"on behalf of," "in the person of," <span class="smcap">God</span>; whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>declaring things past,&mdash;(as when Moses describes the
Creation of the World, the Fall of Man, the Patriarchal
Age): things present,&mdash;(as when St. Luke,
"having had perfect understanding of all things from
the very first," writes of them "in order"): things
future,&mdash;(as when David, and Isaiah, and the rest of
the goodly fellowship, "testified beforehand the sufferings
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and the glory that should follow<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.")
This is no arbitrary statement, but a well-known fact,
which modern unbelievers and ancient heathen writers
have declared with sufficient plainness<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>So long then as the message which the Servant
delivers is prophetic, you do not object to the notion
that it is <span class="smcap">God's</span> message; nay, that the words spoken
are <span class="smcap">God's</span> words. You begin to doubt, it seems,
when a collection of genealogies, (as the two Books
of Chronicles;) or when a story like that contained
in the Book of Esther is concerned.</p>

<p>But what is this but very trifling, and mere childishness?
The message <i>may</i> be mine, it seems, if it
be of a lofty character: it may <i>not</i> be mine if it be of
a homely, ordinary kind!&mdash;I send a message by my
Servant, and he delivers it faithfully: but whether it
<i>is</i> to be called my message, or is <i>not</i> to be called my
message, is to depend entirely on the subject-matter!...
Thus, if a King, refusing to appear in person,
should issue a reprieve to prisoners under sentence
of Death, a proclamation of Peace or of War, an
address to the representatives of the constitution,
(Clergy, Lords, and Commons,) in parliament assembled,&mdash;the
message would be <i>his</i>. But if, on the
contrary, he were only to send a few homely words,
the expression of some wish or intention which has
nothing that seems particularly royal in it,&mdash;then, the
message would <i>cease</i> to be his!... I protest that
as I am unable to see the reasonableness of such
a method of regarding things human, so am I at
a loss to understand why men should so regard
things Divine.</p>

<p>5. This entire matter may be usefully illustrated by
having recourse to an analogy which was established
on a former occasion: namely, the analogy between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>the <i>Written</i> and the <i>Incarnate</i> Word<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>. That our <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus Christ</span> is at once very <span class="smcap">God</span> and very Man, we
all fully admit; although <i>the manner</i> of the union of
<span class="smcap">Godhead</span> and Manhood in His one Person we confess
ourselves quite unable to comprehend. Even so, that
there is a human as well as a Divine element in Holy
Scripture,&mdash;<i>who</i> so blind as to overlook? <i>who</i> so weak
as to deny? And yet, to dissect out that human element,&mdash;<i>who</i>
(but a fool) so rash as to attempt?...
To apply this to the matter before us. <i>Certain parts</i>
of Holy Scripture you think, (for reasons to yourself
best known,) are not to be looked upon as inspired in
the same sense as the rest of the volume. Just as
reasonably might you try to persuade me that our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> was not <i>in the same sense</i> our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> when
He ate and drank at the Pharisees' board, as when
He cast out devils and raised the dead. Was He not
equally the Incarnate <span class="smcap">Word</span> at every stage of His
earthly career; from the time that He was laid in
the manger, until the instant when He expired upon
the Cross? The degradation which He endured in
Pilate's judgment-hall did not affect the reality of the
great truth that the <span class="smcap">Godhead</span> was indissolubly joined
to the Manhood in His Person. He was not less very
<span class="smcap">God</span> as well as very Man when some one spat upon
Him, than at His Transfiguration and at His Ascension
into Heaven!... Why then should the mean
aspect and lowly office of certain parts of Scripture,&mdash;(genealogical
details and the narrative of what we
think ordinary occurrences,)&mdash;be supposed to disentitle
those parts to the praise of being <i>as fully inspired
as any thing in the whole compass of the Bible?</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I may remind you, in passing, that the narrative of
Scripture, even in its humblest, and (to all appearance)
most human parts, has a perpetual note of Divinity
set upon it. The historical portions are throughout
interspersed with indications that the writer is
beholding the transactions which he records, from
a Divine, (not a human,) point of view. <span class="smcap">God</span> is invariably,
(sooner or later,) mentioned as the Agent;
or there is some reference made to <span class="smcap">God</span>; or to <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Word. As Butler expresses it,&mdash;"The general design
of Scripture ... may be said to be, to give us
an account of the world, in this one single view,&mdash;<i>as
<span class="smcap">God's</span> world</i>: by which it appears essentially distinguished
from all other books, so far as I have found,
except such as are copied from it<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I entreat you therefore to disabuse your minds of the
very weak,&mdash;aye and very fatal,&mdash;notion that the catalogue
of the Dukes of Edom is <i>less</i>, or <i>in any different
sense</i>, inspired, from the rest of the narrative in which
it stands. We may not multiply miracles needlessly,
it is true; but neither may we deny the miraculous
character of certain transactions, (as the two Draughts
of Fishes,) which, apart from the recorded attendant
circumstances, would not have been deemed miraculous.&mdash;In
truth, however, Holy Scripture, in one
sense, is a miracle from end to end; and if we may
not multiply miracles needlessly, certainly we are not
at liberty to dismiss the recorded details of a single
miracle, as of no account.&mdash;Consider also, I entreat
you, whether it is credible that Inspiration should be
a thing of such a nature, that it comes and goes,&mdash;is
here and is gone,&mdash;once and again in the course of
a single page. What? does it vanish, like lightning,
when the Evangelist's pen has to record the title on
the Cross,&mdash;to re-appear the instant afterwards?</p>

<p>This allusion to the title on the Cross of our Blessed
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, variously given by each of the four Evangelists,
reminds me of the singular perversity of mankind
when this subject of Inspiration is being treated of;
and to this, I now particularly desire to invite your
attention.&mdash;When a document is simply transcribed
by the Evangelist, or may be <i>supposed</i> to have been
merely transferred to his pages, men assert that so
purely mechanical an act precludes the notion that
Inspiration has had any share in the transaction. Be
it so!&mdash;Behold now, four inspired writers exhibiting
the brief title on our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Cross with considerable
verbal diversity; and you will hear the same critics
open-mouthed against the Evangelists' claim to Inspi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>ration,
for exactly the opposite reason!&mdash;It is just so
of places quoted from the Old Testament in the New.
Faithful transcription, (we are told,) is in the power
of all. What note of an inspired author have we
here? But the places are <i>not</i> faithfully transcribed.
On the contrary. They exhibit every possible degree
of deflection from the original standard. And lo, the
Apostles of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> are thought not to have quite understood
Greek,&mdash;to have mistaken the sense of the
Hebrew,&mdash;and to have been the victims of a most
capricious memory.&mdash;For the last time. Certain narrative
portions of Holy Scripture, (it is assumed,)
could have been written without the aid of Inspiration;
and therefore it is unphilosophical, (we are
told,) to assign to them a divine original. But the
marvellous parts of Holy Scripture, which seem to
claim a loftier original than man's unaided wit,&mdash;<i>these</i>
you view with suspicion, or you deny!...
"Whereunto shall I liken the men of this generation?"</p>

<p>Before dismissing the subject, I must ask you to
observe, that this arbitrary, irreverent method of approaching
Holy Scripture, is absolutely fatal; and
can result in nothing but general unbelief. It confessedly
leaves the individual reader to decide what
parts of the Bible he thinks could, what parts could
not, have been written without Divine assistance;&mdash;a
point on which I am bold to say that he is not competent
even to form an opinion. In other words, it
constitutes every man the judge of how much of the
Bible he will retain,&mdash;how much he will reject. To
put the case yet more plainly, it makes every man
a <span class="smcap">God</span> to himself, and the maker of his own Bible.&mdash;For,
mark you, the exceptions taken against a gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>alogy,
or a catalogue of names, are just as applicable
to the account of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Discourses as given by
St. John. Once convince me that the function of
Inspiration ceases when a genealogy has to be set
down,&mdash;because (say you) it requires no Inspiration
to enable an Evangelist to copy <i>written</i> words;&mdash;and
I shall have no difficulty in convincing myself that
St. John's Gospel, from the xivth to the xviith chapters
inclusive, is not inspired,&mdash;because I cannot <i>but</i>
infer that then neither can it require Inspiration to
enable an Evangelist to copy <i>spoken</i> words.&mdash;The original
fallacy, I repeat,&mdash;the &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;,&mdash;consists
in your supposing yourself a competent judge of
the nature and office of Inspiration; concerning which,
in reality, you know nothing. You can but reverently
examine the phenomena of the Book of Inspiration;
remembering that you have everything to learn.</p>

<p>The Bible, it cannot be too often repeated, too
clearly borne in mind,&mdash;the Bible must stand or fall,&mdash;or
rather, be received or rejected,&mdash;<i>as a whole</i>. A
Divinity hath over-ruled it, that those many Books
of which it is composed should come to be spoken of
collectively as if they were one Book. As it was formerly
called &#7969; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8053;&mdash;"the Scripture,"&mdash;so is it happily
called "the Bible"&mdash;(the Book)&mdash;<i>now</i>. "Moses&mdash;the
Prophets&mdash;and the Psalms," was the recognized
analysis of the volume of the Old Testament.
The Gospels, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse, exhibits
the sum of the contents of the New.&mdash;There is
no disjoining the Law from the Gospel. There is no
disconnecting one Book from its fellows. There is
no eliminating one chapter from the rest. There
is no taking exception against one set of passages, or
supposing that Inspiration has anywhere forgotten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>her office, or discharged it imperfectly. All the
Books of the Bible must stand or fall together.
"Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from
it<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>." It is a fabric hard as adamant; and the gates
of Hell will assuredly never prevail against it. But
remove in thought a single stone; and in thought,
that goodly work of Lawgivers and Judges&mdash;Kings
and Prophets&mdash;Evangelists and Apostles,&mdash;collapses
into a shapeless and unmeaning ruin<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor may it occasion perplexity, or breed mistrust
in any thoughtful mind to find this Book of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Law so complex in its character,&mdash;so various in its
contents,&mdash;so fruitful in its difficulties. Might it
not, on the contrary, have been expected beforehand,
that some analogy would have been recognizable between
the general complexion of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Works and
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word? While I behold the creatures of
<span class="smcap">God</span> so various,&mdash;their functions so marvellous,&mdash;their
nature so little understood,&mdash;the very purpose
of their creation so great a mystery;&mdash;shall I think
it strange that <i>that</i> Book which is but another expression
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Mind and Will, proves diverse in
texture, and difficult of interpretation?&mdash;Shall I grow
rebellious against the message, because the history
of it is hid in the long night of ages; say rather, in
the counsels of <span class="smcap">God's</span> inscrutable will? or shall I be
incredulous that it comes from Heaven, because I see
the fingers of a Man's hand writing upon the plaister of
the wall? or shall I despise those parts of it of which
I cannot detect the medicinal value? As there are
riddles in Nature, so are there riddles in Grace. Anomalies
too, it may be, are discoverable in both worlds.&mdash;Give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>me leave to add, that as the microscope reveals
unsuspected wonders in the one, so does minute examination
bring to light undreamed of perfections in
the other also; unimagined proofs of divine wisdom,
and skill.... But beyond all things, there is perhaps
this further thing which it behoves us to consider:&mdash;that
the field of either is very vast; the subject-matter
very complex: and as, in one, many Professors
are needed,&mdash;(for the Animal kingdom and the
Vegetable kingdom are realms apart: the analysis of
substances, and the structure of the Earth demand the
undivided attention of different minds;)&mdash;so does it
fare with the other also. The languages of Scripture
are in themselves a mighty study; and the collation
of the Text is the portion of a long life. The Law of
Moses would abundantly engross the time of one who
should undertake to explain its depths; as the Gospel
of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> would assuredly fill to overflowing
the soul of another who should desire to appreciate
its perfections. The Prophetic writings are a distinct
field of labour. The same may well be said of the
Epistles of St. Paul. It would be easy to multiply departments&mdash;; for
I have said nothing yet of Sacred History;
and above all, of Sacred Exegesis. But enough
has been stated to introduce the remark that considering
how slenderly one man is able to labour in all
these various provinces, it behoves each one of us to
be humble; and certainly to be a vast deal more mistrustful
of ourselves than some of us unhappily seem
to be; especially when the errand on which we propose
to come abroad is the assailing of the authenticity,
or the morality, or the integrity, or the Inspiration,
of any part of the Bible. Our own amazing ignorance,&mdash;our
many infirmities,&mdash;our faculties limited on every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>side,&mdash;might well keep us humble in the presence of
Him whose knowledge is infinite;&mdash;whose attributes
are all perfections;&mdash;whose very Name is <span class="smcap">Almighty</span>!&mdash;Shall
we, on the contrary, presume to sit in judgment
upon His Word, which claims to be none other than
the authentic record of His Providence,&mdash;the Revelation
of His very mind and will?... Truly, in this
behalf, beyond all others, we seem to stand in need of
the solemn warning: "Dangerous it were for the feeble
brain of Man to wade far into the doings of the Most
High: whom although to know be life, and joy to
make mention of His Name; yet our soundest knowledge
is to know that we know Him not as indeed He
is, neither can know Him. And our safest eloquence
concerning Him is our silence, when we confess without
confession that His glory is inexplicable; His
greatness above our capacity and reach. He is above,
and we upon earth: therefore it behoveth our words
to be wary and few<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>."</p>

<p>And this brings me naturally back to the subject of
my first Sermon from this place; and enables me to
conclude, as I began, with an earnest entreaty to the
younger men present, that,&mdash;whatever their future
destination in life may be,&mdash;but especially if the
Ministry is to be their high privilege, (and the blessedness
of <i>that</i> choice they can have no idea of, until they
prove it by experience!);&mdash;an entreaty, I say, that
they would <i>now</i> be assiduous, and earnest, and regular,
and punctual, and devout, in their daily study of one
chapter of the Bible.&mdash;And while you read the Bible,
read it believing that you are reading an inspired
Book:&mdash;not a Book inspired in parts only, but a Book
inspired in <i>every</i> part:&mdash;not a Book unequally inspired,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>but all inspired equally:&mdash;not a Book generally inspired,&mdash;the
substance indeed given by the Spirit, but
the words left to the option of the writers; but the
words of it, as well as the matter of it, all&mdash;all given
by <span class="smcap">God</span>. As it is written,&mdash;"Man shall not live by
bread alone, but by <i>every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>."</p>

<p>I illustrated sufficiently, last time, in what way
fulness of Inspiration is consistent with the expression
of individual character: even while I availed myself
of the ancient illustration that an inspired writer
is like an instrument in the harper's hand<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. I did
not, of course, "intend thereby to affirm that the
Writers of Holy Scripture were <i>constrained</i> to write,
without any volition or consciousness on their part....
<span class="smcap">Almighty God</span>, while He <i>inspired</i> the Writers of
Scripture, did not impair their moral and intellectual
faculties, nor destroy their personal identity<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>." Let
me not be told therefore that this is to advocate a
mechanical theory of Interpretation. Theory I have
none<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. The Bible comes to me as the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>;
and, <i>as the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>, (the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> being my helper!)
I will receive it. I should as soon think of holding
a theory of Providence and Freewill, as of holding
a theory of Inspiration. I <i>believe</i> in Providence. I
<i>know</i> that I am a free agent. And that is enough for
me.&mdash;The case of Inspiration seems strictly parallel.
I <i>believe</i> in the Divine origin of the Bible. I <i>see</i> that
the writers of the several books wrote like men....
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><i>That</i> outer circle of causation, which, leaving each individual
will entirely free, so controuls without coercing,
so overrules without occasioning, the actions of men,&mdash;that
all things shall work together for good in the
end, and the great designs of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Providence find
free accomplishment;&mdash;all this, far, far transcends
your and my powers of comprehension. It is as much
beyond us as Heaven is higher than the Earth. And,
in like manner, we must be content to own that Inspiration,&mdash;the
analysis of which is so favourite a problem
with this inquisitive age,&mdash;is far, far above us
likewise. To St. Luke "it seemed good" to write
a Gospel; and doubtless he held high communing on
the subject,&mdash;which may, or may not, have sounded
like ordinary human converse,&mdash;with St. Paul. St.
Mark in like sort, beyond a question, enjoyed the help
of St. Peter, while he wrote his Gospel. But St. Peter
and St. Mark, and St. Paul and St. Luke, were all
alike,&mdash;however unconsciously,&mdash;held by the Ancient
of Days within the hollow of His palm; and, as
Augustine says,&mdash;"Whatsoever He willed that <i>we</i>
should read concerning His acts and sayings,&mdash;<i>that</i>
He commissioned the Evangelists to write,&mdash;as though
it had been <i>Himself</i> that wrote it<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>."&mdash;The guidance
was remote, I grant you. The mechanism which
moved the pens of those blessed writers was far above
out of their sight; and complex beyond anything
which the mind of man can imagine; (so that the
publican lisped of "gold, and silver, and brass<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>;"&mdash;and
the companion of St. Peter, at Rome, wrote Latin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>words in Greek letters<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>;&mdash;and the Physician of Antioch
withheld the statement that the woman who had
spent all that she had in consulting many physicians,
"was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>;"&mdash;and
the beloved disciple perhaps indulged his own
personal love while he recalled so largely the discourses
of his <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:)&mdash;but, for all that, the long sequence
of cause and effect existed; and the other
end of that golden chain which terminated in the man,
and the pen, and the ink, and the paper,&mdash;the other
end of it, I say, was held fast within the Hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&mdash;The
method of Inspiration is but another of the
many thousand marvels which on every side surround
me; one of the many things I cannot fully understand,
much less pretend to explain. But I may at
least believe it in silence, and adore<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>.</p>

<p>And,&mdash;(forgive me for keeping you so long; but I
<i>cannot</i> let you go until I have emptied my heart a little
more on this great, and most concerning subject;)&mdash;mark
you, Sirs, however reluctant some of you may
be to admit that you agree with me, you <i>do</i> agree
with me,&mdash;almost to a man. For, what mean your
reasonings on Holy Scripture,&mdash;your sermons, and
your dissertations, and your catechizings,&mdash;your formul&aelig;
of belief, and your definitions of Faith,&mdash;except
you believe in a vast deal more than <i>the substance</i> of
Holy Scripture? How can you pretend to expound
a text, unless you hold <i>the words</i> of that text to be
inspired? What inferences can you venture to draw
from words, the Divinity of which you dare not affirm?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>O, to what endless, hopeless scepticism are you pointing
the way! What a variety of most unanswerable
questionings will you provoke! How can you hope
ever to convince or convict, if you begin by acquainting
your adversary that it is only for the substantial
verity of Scripture that you claim Inspiration; the
verbal details being quite a different matter! See you
not that you put into his hands a weapon with which
he will infallibly slay <i>yourself?</i> Did the Bishops and
Doctors of the Church, when they met in solemn
Council,&mdash;did <i>they</i> hold such a theory concerning
Holy Scripture, think you, as that the matter of it
alone is Divine,&mdash;the language human? More briefly,
that <i>the words</i> of Scripture are <i>not inspired?</i> What
then mean their weighty definitions of Doctrine;&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span>
the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, "Maker of Heaven and Earth,"&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span>
the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, "by whom all things were made:"&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Son</span>, "&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166;,"&mdash;"being of <i>one substance</i>
with the <span class="smcap">Father</span>:"&mdash;"incarnate by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>
of the Virgin Mary:"&mdash;who "descended into Hell"&mdash;"whose
kingdom shall have no end:"&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>, "&#964;&#8056; &#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#958;&#969;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#8055;&#959;&#957;," "who proceeded
from the <span class="smcap">Father</span> and the <span class="smcap">Son</span>?"&mdash;What
means every article of that Creed to which you and I
have given our unfeigned assent, and which Athanasius
would have gladly subscribed to,&mdash;the most
precious jewel in the Church's casket!&mdash;Nay, what
means St. Paul's commentary on the history of Melchizedek,
if the very words <i>omitted</i> from Holy Scripture
are not a <i>Divine</i> omission?</p>

<p>You will perhaps be told hereafter, (I am speaking
now to the younger men,) that quite fatal to this view
of the question, is the state of the Text of Scripture:
that no one can maintain that the words of Scripture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>are inspired, because no one can tell for certain what
the words of Scripture <i>are</i>; or something to that effect.
Now I will not stop to expose the falsity of this charge
against the text of Scripture; (which is implied to be
a very corrupt text, whereas, on the contrary, it is
the best ascertained text of any ancient writing in the
world.) Rather let me remind you, once and for ever,
how to refute this silly sophism,&mdash;the transparent fallacy
of which one would have thought unworthy of
exposure before men of trained understandings; but
that one hears it urged so often and so confidently.
See you not that the state of the text of the Bible has
no more to do with the Inspiration of the Bible, than
the stains on yonder windows have to do with the
light of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Sun? Let me illustrate the matter,&mdash;(though
it surely cannot need illustration!)&mdash;by supposing
the question raised whether Livy did or did
not write the history which goes under his name.
<i>You</i>, (suppose,) are persuaded that he <i>did</i>,&mdash;<i>I</i>, that
he did <i>not</i>. So far, we should both understand, and
perhaps respect one another. But what if I were to
go on to condemn your opinion as untenable, because
of the corrupt state of Livy's <i>text?</i> Would you not
reply that I mistook the question entirely: that <i>you</i>
were speaking of the <i>authorship of the work</i>,&mdash;not
about the <i>fate of the copies!</i> ... Suppose, however,
I were to contend that Livy may indeed have furnished
the matter of his history, but that the form
of expression must needs have been supplied by some
one else; <i>still</i> on the same ground of the corrupt state
of the historian's text. What would you think of me
<i>then?</i>&mdash;a man who not only confounded two things
utterly dissimilar,&mdash;(the authorship of a book, and
the amount of care with which it had been transcribed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>and printed;)&mdash;but who was for distinguishing the
mind of the writer from the expression of that mind;
the <i>thoughts</i>, from the <i>words</i> which are essential to
their transmission! A hopelessly illogical person,
surely!</p>

<p>O no, Sirs! Banish the fancy at once and for ever
from your minds. You cannot thus dissect Inspiration
into substance and form. It is a mere delusion
of these last days,&mdash;prated of from man to man,
until respectable persons begin to give in to the fallacy;
and persuade themselves that they themselves
believe it. They hope thus to avoid the danger which
is supposed to attach to hearty belief in the Bible as
the very Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>; as well as to secure for themselves
a side-door, (so to speak,) by which to escape,
whenever they are inconveniently hard pressed. How
much more faithful, to leave <span class="smcap">God</span> to take care of His
own! How much more manly, to be prepared sometimes
to confess ignorance!... As for <i>thoughts</i> being
inspired, apart from the <i>words</i> which give them expression,&mdash;you
might as well talk of a tune without
notes, or a sum without figures. No such dream can
abide the daylight for a moment. No such theory
of Inspiration, (for a theory it <i>is</i>, and a most audacious
one too!), is even intelligible. It is as illogical
as it is worthless; and cannot be too sternly put down.
The philosophical mind of Greece, (far better taught!),
knew of only one word for both Reason and the expression
of it. Lodged within the chambers of the
brain, or put forth into living energy,&mdash;it was still,
with them, the &#923;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;.&mdash;I invite you, as the only intelligible
view of the matter,&mdash;your only alternative,
unless you resolve to run the risk of the most irrational
rationalism,&mdash;to take this high view of Inspi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>ration:
to believe, concerning the Bible, that it is in
the most literal sense imaginable, verily and indeed,
<i>the Word</i> of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>And do you,&mdash;(for I am still addressing myself to
the younger men,)&mdash;learn to put away from your
souls that vile indifferentism which is becoming the
curse of this shallow and unlearned age. Be as forgiving
as you please of indignities offered to yourselves;
but do not be ashamed to be very jealous
for the honour of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of Hosts; and to resent
any dishonour offered to Him, with a fiery indignation
utterly unlike anything you could possibly feel
for a personal wrong. Attend ever so little to the
circumstance, and you will perceive that every form
of fashionable impiety is one and the same vile thing
in the essence of it: still Antichrist, disguise it how
you will. We were reminded last Sunday that the
sensualist, by following the gratification of his own
unholy desires, in bold defiance of <span class="smcap">God's</span> known Law,
is in reality setting himself up in the place of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and becoming a <span class="smcap">God</span> unto himself<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. The same is
true of the Idolatry of Human Reason; and of Physical
Science: as well as of that misinformed Moral
Sense which finds in the Atonement of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> nothing
but a stone of stumbling and a snare. It is
true of Popish error also;&mdash;for what else is this but
a setting up of the Human above the Divine,&mdash;(Tradition,
the worship of the Blessed Virgin, the casuistry
of the Confessional, and the like,)&mdash;and so, once more
substituting the creature for the Creator?&mdash;What
again is the fashionable intellectual sin of the day,
but the self-same detestable offence, under quite a
different disguise? The idea of Law,&mdash;(<i>that</i> old idea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>which is declared to be only now emerging into supremacy
in Science,)&mdash;takes the hideous shape of rebellion
against its Maker; and pronounces, now Miracles,
now Prophecy, now Inspiration itself, to be a thing
impossible; or is content to insinuate that the disclosures
of Revelation are at least untrue. What is
this, I say, but another form of the self-same iniquity,&mdash;a
setting up of the creature before the Creator who
is blessed for evermore; a substitution of some created
thing in the place of <span class="smcap">God</span>!</p>

<p>The true antidote to all such forms of impiety,
believe me, is not controversy of any sort; but the
childlike study of the Bible, each one for himself,&mdash;not
without prayer.&mdash;Humble must we be, as well as
assiduous; for the powers of the mind as well as the
affections of the heart should be prostrated before the
Bible, or a man will derive little profit from his study
of it. Humble, I repeat, for mysteries, (remember),
are revealed unto the meek<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>; and the fear of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> is the beginning of Wisdom<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>; and he that
would understand more than the Ancients must keep
<span class="smcap">God's</span> precepts<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>; and it is the commandments of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> which give light unto the eyes<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.&mdash;The dutiful
student of the Bible is permitted to see the mist melt
away from many a speculative difficulty; and is many
a time reminded of that saying of his <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;"Do
ye not therefore err, <i>because ye know not the Scriptures</i>,
neither the power of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>?" ... The humble and
attentive reader of the Bible becomes impressed at
last with a sense of its Divinity, analogous I suppose
to the conviction of Eleven of the Apostles that the
Man they walked with was none other than the <span class="smcap">Son</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>of <span class="smcap">God</span>. <i>That</i> similarity of allusion,&mdash;<i>that</i> sameness
of imagery,&mdash;<i>that</i> oneness of design,&mdash;<i>that</i> uniformity
of sentiment,&mdash;<i>that</i> ever-recurring anticipation of the
Gospel message;&mdash;<i>all</i> goes to produce a secret and
sure conviction that every writer, under whatever
variety of circumstances, had access to but one Treasury,&mdash;drew
from but one and the same Well of living
water. Marks of purpose, shewn in the choice or
collocation of single words, often strike an attentive
reader; which, singly, might be thought fortuitous;
but which, collectively, can only be accounted for on
a very different principle. The beautiful structure
of the Gospels strikes him especially; and he could
as soon believe that a song harmonized for four Angel
voices had been the result of accident, as that the
Evangelists had achieved their task without special
aid, throughout, from Heaven. A lock of very complicated
mechanism, which four keys of most peculiar
structure will open simultaneously,&mdash;must have been
as evidently made for them, as they for it.</p>

<p>It is almost treason, in truth, to the Majesty of
Heaven to discuss the Bible on the low ground which
I have been hitherto forced to occupy. It is quite
monstrous, in the first University of the most favoured
of Christian lands, that a man should be compelled
thus to lift up his voice in defence of the very Inspiration
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word. O that Divine narrative,
which is for ever rending aside the veil, and disclosing
to us the counsels of the presence-chamber of the
<span class="smcap">Almighty</span>!&mdash;O those human characters, beset with
all the infirmities of our fallen nature,&mdash;whose words
and actions yet are shadows of things heavenly and
eternal!&mdash;O that majestic retinue of types which,
from the very birthday of recorded Time, heralded the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>approach of the King of Glory!&mdash;O that scarlet thread
which runs through all the seemingly tangled web of
Scripture, to terminate only in the cross of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!&mdash;How
do the features of the Gospel struggle into sight
through the veil of the Law! How do the holy and
humble men of heart ever and anon break out into
speech, as it were, before the time;&mdash;as if they felt
the burden of silence too great to be endured!...
Whence is it that we dare to handle the pages of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> Book as if they were a common thing,&mdash;doubting,
questioning, cavilling, disbelieving, denying?
Why choose for ourselves the soldiers' part, who
buffeted, reviled, smote, spat upon Him?... O my
friends, far, far be all this from you and from me!
Never imagine, because this day we have thus spoken,
that such discussions are congenial to us; or that we
deem them the proper theme for addresses from the
pulpit; although the coincidence of this day's Collect
seems, for once, to lend a kind of sanction to our present
endeavours. Look through the whole range of
patristic homilies, and you will not find <i>one</i> of the
kind, with which, unhappily, our ears are grown so
familiar in this place,&mdash;ingenious attempts to evacuate
Holy Writ of its fulness, on the one hand;&mdash;or apologies
of some sort for its Divinity and Inspiration,
on the other. You will take, if you are wise, far,
far higher ground, in your private study of its pages;
remembering that "the most generous faith is invariably
the truest;"&mdash;nor ever stoop so low as <i>we</i>
have been this day doing. Waste not thy precious
time in cavil about the structure of the casket which
contains thy treasure; but unlock it once with the
Key of Faith, and make thyself rich indeed.&mdash;Already,&mdash;
(as we were last week reminded),&mdash;already the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>Judge standeth at the door; and assuredly, thou and
I, (to whom <span class="smcap">God</span> hath entrusted so much!) shall have
to render a very strict account of the use we have
made of the Bible,&mdash;when we shall stand face to face
with its undoubted Author. The season of the year
reminds us, as with a trumpet, of that tremendous
hour when the veil will be withdrawn from our eyes,&mdash;and
the office of Faith will be ended,&mdash;and we shall
be confronted with One who hath "a vesture dipped
in blood, and whose Name is called <span class="smcap">The Word of
God</span>." ... "I <i>have heard of Thee</i>," (we shall, every one
of us, exclaim),&mdash;"I <i>have heard of Thee</i>, by the hearing
of the ear; but <i>now</i>,&mdash;mine eye <i>seeth</i> Thee<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>!"</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<h3>SUPPLEMENT TO SERMON IV</h3>


<p>There is yet another view of the nature and office
of Inspiration,&mdash;another 'Theory' as it would perhaps
aspire to be called,&mdash;which limits <i>the extent</i> of the
Divine help and guidance which the writers, confessedly
inspired, may be supposed to have enjoyed.
According to this view, it is admitted that Inspiration
was, from first to last, a continuous influence; exerted
equally throughout: but then, it has been suggested
that perhaps <i>its office</i> was not to protect a Writer
against a certain class of errors. The office of the
Bible, (it is argued,) is to make men wise unto Salvation.
It does not follow that Inspiration, because it
guided a sacred writer so long as he wrote of Christian
Doctrine, so as to make what he wrote unerringly
true, should have protected him against slips of
memory; preserved him from inaccuracies of statement;
from inconclusive reasonings; from incorrect
quotations; from mistaken inferences; from scientific
errors.&mdash;This is what is said: and because this is
a view of the question which is observed to recommend
itself occasionally to candid, and even to reverential
minds, it seems to deserve distinct and careful
consideration.</p>

<p>But I must preface all I have to reply by remarking
that "a Book cannot [properly] be said to be inspired,
or to carry with it the authority of being <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word,
if only <i>portions</i> come from Him, and there exists no
plain and infallible sign to indicate <i>which</i> those por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>tions
are; and if the same Writer may give us in one
verse of the Bible a revelation from the <span class="smcap">Most High</span>,
and in the next verse a blunder of his own. How can
we be certain, that the very texts, upon which we
rest our doctrines and hopes, are not the <i>uninspired</i>
portions? What can be the meaning or nature of an
Inspiration to teach Truth, which does not guarantee
its recipient from error?"&mdash;So far a living sceptical
writer.</p>

<p>1. Now, the first thing which strikes one in this
theory, is its extreme vagueness. We hardly know
what we have to consider; for nothing is definitely
stated. Neither are we informed how many of the
phenomena of Inspiration, this view is intended to
explain. Again, does the theory apply equally to the
Old Testament and to the New? If it does apply
equally to the Old Testament, (and I can see no
possible reason why it should <i>not</i>,) then, I apprehend
this theory will be found <i>practically</i> to run up into,
and to identify itself with, that last described<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>. For
a guidance <i>which has failed to guide</i>, has been no guidance
at all; and since whole chapters of the Old
Testament will occur to every one's memory which
may be thought to have no connexion whatever with
'Christian Doctrine,'&mdash;to conduce wondrous little to
the 'making men wise unto Salvation,'&mdash;it will follow
that Inspiration is, according to this theory, in effect,
of the nature already described,&mdash;namely, a quality
which can never be predicated of any passage of
Scripture with entire certainty. The larger part of
the Old Testament in fact, by this theory, is exhibited
in the light of a common book; having no pretension
to be regarded as part of the Inspired Canon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
But if this theory simply shirks the question of the
Old Testament, then, those who are inclined to accept
it, are bound to explain why there should be one
theory of Inspiration applicable to the Old Testament,
and another for the New:&mdash;in which difficulty, I must
candidly profess that I am not able to render any
assistance at all. It is clearly not allowable to overlook
the intimate connexion which subsists between
the two great divisions of Holy Scripture; the habitual
references of the Writers of the New Testament
to the writers of the Old,&mdash;Moses, David, Isaiah, and
the rest;&mdash;or rather, <i>to the utterance of the</i> <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>, <i>speaking by the mouth of those writers</i>. Whatever
may have been the Inspiration of the Authors of
the New Testament must be assumed to have been
that of the Authors of the Old Testament also.</p>

<p>2. But further,&mdash;(to confine our remarks to the
Scriptures of the New Testament; which, it is manifest,
the view under consideration specially contemplates;)&mdash;however
plausible in the abstract a theory
may sound, which would account for a Chronological
difficulty,&mdash;the insertion of what seems to be a wrong
name,&mdash;a quotation made with singular license,&mdash;an
unscientific statement,&mdash;the apparent inconsistency of
two or more accounts of one and the same transaction,
in respect of lesser details,&mdash;a (supposed) inconclusive
remark, or specimen of reasoning which seems to be
fallacious;&mdash;on the supposition that it is not the office
of Inspiration to enlighten the understanding on points
like these, or to preserve the pen from error;&mdash;however
plausible, I say, this theory, abstractedly considered,
may appear;&mdash;it will be found that it will not
bear the searching test of a practical application.</p>

<p>It would indeed be a great advantage to the cause
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>of Truth, and a great help to individual minds, as well
as wonderfully promote the arriving at a sound conclusion
in this perilous department of speculative
Divinity,&mdash;if, instead of putting up with a vague
theory, (like the present,) regardless of its logical
bearings and necessary issues;&mdash;men would compel
themselves to apply their view to the actual phenomena
of Holy Scripture: to carry it out to its legitimate
consequences, and steadily to contemplate the
result. I venture to predict that the theory which we
are now considering, when submitted to such a test,
would be found not only inconvenient, but absolutely
untenable. The inconsistency and absurdity which results
from it, can, I think, easily be made to appear.</p>

<p>For if any one who is disposed to regard it with
favour,&mdash;instead of idly, (as is the way with nine-tenths
of mankind,) repeating the formula in terms
more or less vague and indefinite; and straightway
wincing, falling back on generalities, and in a word
shirking the point, the instant it is proposed to bring
the question to a definite issue;&mdash;if a favourer of the
present theory I say, instead of so acting, would take
up a copy of the New Testament, and proceed, with
a pen in his hand, to <i>apply</i> the theory, by running
his pen through the places, (and they <i>must</i> be capable
of individual specification!), which he suspects of
being external to the influence of Inspiration;&mdash;or, if
you please, which he thinks have been penned without
that Divine help which makes what is written
infallible;&mdash;I venture to predict that such an one will
speedily admit that his erasures are either so very
few, or so very many, as to be fatal to the theory of
which they are the expression.</p>

<p>If they be confined to "the fifteenth year of Tibe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>rius<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>;
to the names of the second Cainan<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>, Cyrenius<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>,
Abiathar<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>, 'Jeremy the prophet<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>;'" to "the sixth
hour<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>," and so on;&mdash;no great inconvenience truly
will result. But the instant you go a step further,
the difficulty begins. Many of the quotations from
the Old Testament may be made to correspond with
the Hebrew, doubtless, without sensible inconvenience:
but there are others which refuse the process.
However, let it be supposed that all such indications
of imperfect memory, or misapprehension of the sense
of the Hebrew Scriptures, have been removed; and
here and there, that an irrelevant clause in the
reasoning has been lopped off, or an unscientific remark
expunged.&mdash;After all this has been done, I venture
to say that the result will be the reverse of
satisfactory, even to the theorist himself. He will
infallibly exclaim secretly,&mdash;I seem to have gained
wondrous little by this corrective process. Was it
worth while, in order to achieve <i>this</i>, to tamper with
the Divine Oracles? The great body of Scripture
remains after all, in all its strangeness, all its perplexing
individuality. Meanwhile, piety and wisdom
modestly suggest,&mdash;Is it reasonable to think that
Evangelists and Apostles should have stumbled, like
children, before dates, and names, and quotations from
their own Scriptures? Surely if <i>this</i> be all that can
be objected against the Bible, the very slenderness of
the charge becomes its sufficient refutation!...
<i>The erasures are so few, in fact, that they refute the
theory.</i></p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, the pen be freely used,
then the result will be fatal to the theory, <i>because it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>will be fatal to the record</i>. If an 'Essayist and Reviewer'
were to reduce the Gospels to consistency,
according to <i>his</i> view of consistency, the Gospels
would scarcely be recognizable. If he were to reject
from St. Paul's writings every instance of what <i>he</i>
thinks fanciful exposition, illogical reasoning, inexact
quotation, and mistaken inference; the result would
be altogether unmanageable. For any one who attends
to the matter will perceive that such things
run into the very staple of the Apostle's argument;
and therefore cannot be detached without destroying
the whole. The householder's reason for not removing
the tares, ("lest while ye gather up the tares ye
root up also the wheat with them<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>,") applies exactly.
If St. Paul's exposition of Melchizedek be fanciful and
untrustworthy, then does the proof of the superiority
of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> Priesthood over that of Aaron, fall
to the ground. If his handling of the story of Sarah
and Hagar be an uninspired allegory, then does his
argumentation respecting the rejection of the Jews
and the calling of the Gentiles disappear. If the furniture
of the Temple, and the provisions of the Jewish
ritual, were not dictated by the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>, then
will the Epistle wherein it is found be reduced to
proportions which make it meaningless. If Deuteronomy
xxv. 4 has no reference to the Christian Ministry,
then the entire context (in two of St. Paul's
Epistles) must go at once<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>.... It is useless to multiply
such instances. Any one familiar with the writings
of St. Paul will know the truth of what has been
offered; and will admit that the erasures required by
the theory before us will become so numerous as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>prove,&mdash;(to a devout mind at least, or indeed to any
one of sense and candour,)&mdash;that the theory is altogether
untenable.</p>

<p>It cannot escape observation, therefore, that however
plausible this view of Inspiration may sound, as
long as some few petty historical, chronological, and
scientific inaccuracies are all that have to be accounted
for;&mdash;the theory (unhappily) proves worthless when
it comes to be practically applied; inasmuch as in
the writings of St. Paul, for example, there is little
or nothing of the kind just specified, to be condoned.
Erroneous dates, unscientific statements, wrong names,
and the like, form no part of the staple of the New
Testament. Such instances may be counted on one's
fingers; and are to be sufficiently explained to render
any special theory of Inspiration in order to meet
them, quite a gratuitous exercise of ingenuity.</p>

<p>3. On the other hand, if a wider class of phenomena
is to be dealt with by this theory, the reader is requested
to observe that we involve ourselves in a gross
contradiction; for we forsake the very principle on
which it pretends to be built. The theory set out by
reminding us that "the office of the Bible is to make
men wise unto Salvation,"&mdash;not to teach physical
Science, nor to deal with facts in chronology and the
like: and the plea was allowed. But the theory which
was devised to account for one class of phenomena is
now most unwarrantably applied to account for another.
We have travelled into a widely different subject-matter,&mdash;namely,
<i>Divinity proper!</i> Let it therefore
be respectfully asked,&mdash;If the Inspiration which
the Apostles enjoyed did not preserve them against
unsound inferences in respect of <i>Holy Scripture</i>; and
illogical, inconclusive argumentation in <i>things Divine</i>;&mdash;pray,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>of what use was it? We have not been reviewing
a set of <i>Geological</i> mistakes on the part of the
great Apostle. To Physical Science, he has scarcely
so much as a single allusion. He deals with <i>Christian
Doctrine</i>; with <i>Divinity</i>, properly so called; and <i>with
that only</i>. Pray, was not Inspiration a sufficient guide
to him, <i>there</i>?</p>

<p>4. It is high time also to remind the reader that
although the office of the Bible, confessedly, is "to
make men wise unto Salvation," it does not by any
means follow that <i>that</i> is its <i>only</i> office. In other
words, we have no right to assume that we know all
the possible ends for which the Bible was designed;
and to lay it down, as if it were an ascertained fact,
that it was <i>not</i> designed to enlighten men in matters
of Chronology, History, and the like; seeing, on the
one hand, that all the evidence we are able to adduce
in support of such an opinion, does not establish so
much as a faint presumption that any part of Scripture
is uninspired; and seeing that, on the other, as a plain
matter of fact, historical details constitute so large a
part of the contents of the Bible; and that the sacred
volume is <i>the sole depository</i> of the History and Chronology
of the World for by far the largest portion of
the interval since that World's Creation.</p>

<p>5. In passing, it may also be reasonably declared,
that it is to take a very derogatory view of the result
of the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>'s influence, to suppose that imperfections
and inaccuracies can freely abound,&mdash;nay, can
exist at all,&mdash;in a Revelation which the same <span class="smcap">Holy
Spirit</span> is believed to have inspired. They ought surely
to be <i>demonstrated</i> to exist, before we are called upon
to listen to the apologies which have been invented
to account for their existence!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
6. Let me also advert to a dilemma which seems
hardly ever to obtain from a certain class of critics the
attention it deserves. If a writing be not inspired,
<i>it is of no absolute authority</i>. If a part of a writing
be not inspired, that part is of no absolute authority.
If a single word in the text of Holy Scripture be even
uncertain,&mdash;(as, for example, whether we are to read
&#927;&#931; or &#920;&#917;&#927;&#931; in 1 Tim. iii. 16,)&mdash;<i>that word becomes without
absolute authority</i>. We cannot venture to adduce
it <i>in proof</i> of anything. Without therefore, in the
remotest degree, desiring to discourage the application
of a <i>true</i> theory of Inspiration to the phenomena
of Holy Scripture, through fear of the necessary consequences,&mdash;may
we not call attention to the manifest
awkwardness of a theory which no one knows how to
apply, and about the application of which no two men
will ever be agreed?&mdash;the issue of the discussion
being, in every case, neither more nor less than this,&mdash;whether
the portion of Scripture under consideration
is Human, and therefore <i>of no absolute authority</i>; or
Divine, and therefore <i>infallible</i>!</p>

<p>7. A far more important consideration remains to
be offered, and with this I shall conclude. Although,
when St. Paul appears to reason inconclusively, some
of us do not hesitate to refer the Apostle's (supposed)
imperfect logic to his personal infirmity,&mdash;yet, common
piety revolts against the proposal to apply the
same solution to the same phenomenon when it is
observed to occur in the Discourses of our Blessed
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself. It seems to have been providentially
ordained, however, that the discourses of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself
should supply examples of every one of those
difficulties which it is thought lawful to account for,&mdash;when
an Apostle or an Evangelist is the speaker,&mdash;on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>the hypothesis of partial, imperfect, or suspended
Inspiration. Now, since <i>I</i>, at least, shall not be permitted
to be either vague or general, I proceed to
subjoin the proof of what has been thus advanced:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#945;. The well-known difficulty about "the days of
Abiathar," <i>is found in one of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> discourses</i><a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>.
Here then is a case of what, if an Evangelist or an
Apostle had been the author of the statement, would
have been called an historical inaccuracy.</p>

<p>&#946;. However unworthy of scientific attention the
Mosaic account of the descent of Mankind from a
single pair may be deemed,&mdash;the universality of 'the
Noachian Deluge,'&mdash;the destruction of the Cities of the
plain,&mdash;the fate of Lot's wife,&mdash;Jonah in the fish's
belly,&mdash;and so forth;&mdash;to all these (supposed) unscientific
statements our Blessed <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commits Himself
unequivocally<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>.</p>

<p>&#947;. When the Holy One inferred the Resurrection
of the Dead from the words spoken to Moses "in the
bush<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>;"&mdash;when He proved that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is not the son of
David, because "David in spirit calls Him '<span class="smcap">Lord</span><a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>;'"&mdash;and
when He shewed from a clause in the 6th verse
of the lxxxiind Psalm, ("I said ye are gods,") that it
was not unlawful for Himself to claim the title of <span class="smcap">Son</span>
of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>;&mdash;I humbly think that the argumentation is
of such a nature as would not produce conviction in
captious minds cast in a modern mould<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>. I desire not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>to dwell longer upon this subject; and only hope in
what I have ventured to say concerning some of the
recorded sayings of Him to whose creative Power and
Goodness I am indebted for the exercise of my own
reason,&mdash;I have not written amiss. But the point of
what I am urging is, that I defy any one to bring
a charge of faulty logic against passages in St. Paul's
Epistles which might not, <i>with the same show of reason</i>,
be brought against certain of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>'s recorded
sayings.</p>

<p>&#948;. When the Chief Priests and Scribes remonstrated
with our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> because of the children crying in the
Temple; and asked Him,&mdash;"Hearest Thou what these
say?" He replied,&mdash;"Yea, have ye never read, 'Out
of the mouths of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected
praise<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>?'" ... Now, this quotation from the
viiith Psalm is what an 'Essayist or Reviewer' would
have pronounced irrelevant.</p>

<p>&#949;. It seems clear from Gen. ii. 24, that <i>Adam</i> was
the author of the words, "Therefore shall a man leave
his father and his mother," &amp;c. And yet, our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
(in St. Matth. xix. 4, 5,) as unmistakeably seems to
make <span class="smcap">God</span> the Speaker. An Evangelist or an Apostle
would be thought here to have made a slip of
memory.</p>

<p>&#950;. In St. John viii. 47, the following words occur.
"He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>hear them not, because ye are not of God." This
passage (as already pointed out<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>,) has been adduced
by one who now occupies an Archiepiscopal throne, as
containing a logical fallacy.</p>

<p>Many more examples might be adduced: but these
will suffice. It is plain that when the like phenomena
are observed in the writings of Apostles and Evangelists,
we need not, in order to account for them,
have recourse to any theory of partial or imperfect Inspiration;
since nothing of the kind is supposed necessary
when they occur in the Discourses of our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&mdash;As much as I care to offer on the subject of
<i>Inspired Reasoning</i> will be found in the course of the
Sixth of these Sermons, where the Doctrine of 'Accommodation'
is considered.</p>

Lexicon, on the noun,) "there was this necessarily attached; that
he spoke not his own words, but those which he had divinely received;
(see Philo, t. iv. p.&nbsp;116, ed. Pfeifferi,&mdash;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957;

he was the messenger of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the declarer of His will. This
is clear from a passage of peculiar authority in this matter, (Ex.
vii. 1,)&mdash;where <span class="smcap">God</span> says to Moses,&mdash;'I have made thee a god to
Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother <i>shall be thy prophet</i>.'" ... Elsewhere,
(speaking of the Hebrew verb, 'to prophesy,') Gesenius has
the following remarkable statement:&mdash;"The <i>passive forms</i>, Niphal
and Hithpael, are used in this verb; from the Divine Prophets
having been <i>supposed to be moved rather by another's powers than
their own</i>." (Just as if the Oracles of <span class="smcap">God</span> were not express on the
subject! viz. "No prophecy ever came by the will of Man; but,
[because they were] borne along (&#966;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;) by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>,
spake those holy men of <span class="smcap">God</span>."&mdash;2 St. Pet. i. 21.)
</p><p>
&#928;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962;, in fact, means 'an interpreter' rather than 'a prophet,'
(for which, in our popular sense, the Greek is rather &#956;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#962;:) hence
the use of the words &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962;, &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8059;&#969;, &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8055;&#945; in the New
Testament, e.g. 1 Thess. v. 20. 1 Cor. xi. 4: xii. 10. Rom. xii. 6,
(where see Wordsworth.) See also 1 Cor. xiv. 1, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.: in
all which places, the &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962; was what we should rather now call
<i>a preacher</i>. But then, the expounding of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word is the special
function of the preacher's office from which he takes this name.&mdash;The
reader is referred to Blomfield's Glossary, <i>Agam.</i> v. 399, and to
Liddell and Scott's <i>Lexicon</i>; (in both of which, some important
references are given:) also to Trench's <i>Synonyms of the New

expressed in a volume of Sermons which deserves to be far better
known than it is:&mdash;"I suppose that if there is one portion of the
Old Testament which a discriminator would set aside as less needing
to be reckoned inspired than other parts, it is the Historical; the
books which are strictly narrative. Now it may seem to have been
providentially ordered, in the purpose of meeting this view, that
these books are made to bear on them most peculiarly the stamp
and the claim of Inspiration. For they do not profess to be so
much the account of what Man did, as what <span class="smcap">God</span> did in ruling
men, and guiding human events. They are a history of a providential
course of events, and, (which is the point,) as seen from
the providential point of view. They are a history written not on
Earth, but above the skies. Events are spoken of therefore in this
view. A man's obduracy is recorded thus,&mdash;'<span class="smcap">God</span> hardened his
heart.' A king numbers his people; it is recorded as a thing
suggested in the spiritual world. In fact, the historic volume of
the Old Testament is a history of the secret springs of things; it is
a narrative of things which none but <span class="smcap">God Almighty</span> could know;
not Man's Word therefore at all, but <span class="smcap">God's</span>."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>, by the

<p>It is impossible to preserve exact method in Sermons
like these, uncertain in number, and delivered at
irregular intervals. It shall only be stated that, having
already spoken at considerable length, of the <span class="smcap">Inspiration</span>
of Holy Scripture;&mdash;not, one part more, one
part less, but every part equally inspired throughout;
not general, (whatever the exact notion may be of
a book <i>generally</i> inspired,) but particular, by which I
mean that <i>every word</i> is none other than the utterance
of the Holy Ghost<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>: having, moreover, explained the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>reasonableness,&mdash;(the logical necessity, as it seems,)&mdash;of
giving such an account of the Bible;&mdash;I propose
to-day to proceed to the subject of <span class="smcap">Interpretation</span>.
Really, it has become the fashion of a School of unbelief
which has lately emerged into infamous notoriety,
to deal with both these questions in so insolent
a style of dogmatism, that the preacher is compelled
to halt <i>in limine</i>; and to explain that he begs that no
offence may be taken at the account which he has just
given of the Bible; for that really he means no more
than Bp. Pearson meant when he said that "<i>the Scripture
phrase</i>" is "<i>the Language of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span></i><a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>:"&mdash;that
he desires to say no other thing than what <i>He</i>
said, by whose Spirit, (as St. Peter declares<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>,) the prophets
prophesied;&mdash;the preacher, I say, wishes to explain
that he desires to mean no other thing than our
<span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span> Himself meant, when He spoke of
"<i>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>."</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Interpretation</span>, then, in the largest sense of the
term, I take to denote the discovery of the method
and meaning of Holy Scripture.&mdash;I exclude those
critical labours which merely aim at establishing a
correct text.&mdash;I exclude also the learning which
merely investigates the grammatical force of single
words. True, that even to translate is often to interpret;
but this results only from the imperfection of
language,&mdash;which can seldom represent the words of
one idiom by the words of another, without at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>same time parting with the associations which belong
to the old words, and importing those which are inseparable
from the new.&mdash;Moreover, except occasionally,
it is presumed that the lore of the Antiquary,
Geographer, and so forth, does not aspire to the dignity
of Interpretation.&mdash;To be brief,&mdash;whatever simply
puts us on a level with ordinary hearers of ancient
days; does no more than inform us what custom,
locality, or date is intended by the sacred writer;
(things which once were obvious, and which <i>ought not</i>
to be any difficulty now;)&mdash;all this, I say, seems external
to the province of Interpretation; the purpose
of which is to discover <i>the method</i> and <i>the meaning</i> of
Holy Writ. And I find that every extant specimen
of this sacred Science is either (1)&nbsp;what <span class="smcap">God</span> hath
Himself revealed; or (2)&nbsp;what the Church hath with
authority delivered; or (3)&nbsp;what individuals have
thought themselves competent to declare.</p>

<p>Of these three authorities concerning the sense of
Scripture, it is evident that the last-named is entitled
to least notice. So unimportant indeed is it, as
scarcely to be of any weight at all. What one individual
asserts, on his own unsupported authority, another
individual may, with as much or as little authority,
deny; and <i>who</i> is to decide?</p>

<p>But the authority indicated in the second place,
clearly challenges very different attention. When, for
example, our own Hooker declares, concerning the 5th
verse of the iiird chapter of St. John, that "of all the
ancients <i>there is not one to be named</i> that ever did otherwise
expound or allege this place than as implying external
Baptism<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>," we perceive at once that such consent,
on the part of men in whose ears the echoes of the Apostolic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Age had not yet quite ceased to vibrate; and
who were themselves professors of that Divine Science
which takes cognizance of the subject-matter in hand:&mdash;such
general consent of Antiquity, I say, on a
point of Interpretation, must evidently be held to be
decisive.</p>

<p>"Religio mihi est, eritque, contra torrentem omnium
Patrum, Sanctas Scripturas interpretari; nisi
quando me argumenta cogunt evidentissima,&mdash;quod
nunquam eventurum credo<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>." So spake one who
had read the Fathers with no common care, and
who turned his reading to no common account. "I
persuade myself," he says, "that you will learn the
modesty of submitting your judgment to that of the
Catholic Doctors, where they are found generally to
concur in the interpretation of a text of Scripture,
how absurd soever that interpretation may, at first
appearance, seem to be. For upon a diligent search
you will find, that <i>aliquid latet quod non patet</i>,&mdash;'there
is a mystery in the bottom:' and that which at first
view seemed even ridiculous, will afterwards appear
to be a most certain truth<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>." "No man can oppose
Catholic consent, but he will at last be found to oppose
both the Divine Oracles and Sound Reason<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
The distinction thus drawn between individual opinion
and the collective voice of the Church, was far
better understood anciently than at present. The interpretation
of a Council, especially if [oe]cumenical,
was accounted decisive. Even the generally consentient
voice of Doctors and Fathers, as far as it could
be ascertained, was held to be of the same authoritative
kind. An interesting illustration occurs. Than
Eusebius, Bishop of C&aelig;sarea, few Fathers of the fourth
century were more learned in Holy Scripture. He,
commenting upon "the Captain of the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Host,"
mentioned in the vth chapter of the Book of Joshua,
delivers it as his opinion that it was the same Personage
who spoke to Moses 'in the Bush;' viz. the
Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span><a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>. On which opinion, a learned man of
the same age, in a scholion of singular beauty which
has come down to us, remarks as follows:&mdash;"Aye,
but the Church, O most holy Eusebius, holds a view
on this subject altogether at variance with thine<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>He goes on to allege reasons why the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#8049;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#962;
of Joshua must be held to have been not an <i>uncreated</i>,
but a <i>created</i> Angel; the Archangel Michael, in fact.
We will not now go into that matter. You are but
requested to observe, how profoundly unimportant the
opinion of a very learned individual was held to be,
by one in whose ears the Patristic "torrent" was yet
sounding; although Justin Martyr is known to have
been of the same mind with Eusebius.&mdash;And thus
much for individual views as to the meaning of Holy
Scripture; as contrasted with the decisions of Councils
and Fathers. To judge from the signs of the Age,
we have exactly reversed the ancient estimate; and
expect that more respect will be shewn to our own
private fancies, than to a general consensus of Divines,
ancient and modern. It seems to have been discovered
that the supreme guide of Life is the individual conscience,&mdash;"without
appeal&mdash;except to himself<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>!"</p>

<p>II. Before descending, however, to the <i>business</i> of
Interpretation, there is clearly one preliminary question
to be settled: namely, <i>the principle</i> on which Interpretation
is to be conducted. And this is all that
can be discussed to-day. To seek for that principle
in the contradictory pages of solitary theorists, would
of course be hopeless, as well as absurd. To elicit it
from Patristic Commentaries, would obviously leave
a door open for cavil. The ancient Fathers, (allowing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>that they often speak with consentient voice,) singly,
were but fallible men,&mdash;however famous, as professors
of Theological Science, they may have been. <i>This</i>,
however, I venture to assume without any hesitation
whatever,&mdash;that if, instead of either of these two ways
of ascertaining how Holy Scripture ought to be handled,
we can be so fortunate as to discover from the
Inspired Writers themselves what <i>their</i> method was
with respect to the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;in such case, I
say, we shall be in a position of entire certainty<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>.
We shall then have full warrant for disregarding
the dicta of modern sciolists on this great subject;&mdash;however
arrogant their dogmatism, however confident
their unsupported asseverations.</p>

<p>I desire to be very clearly understood. My position
is this. All Christian men allow that the Apostles
and Evangelists of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> were inspired.
Before such an audience as the present, I will not
condescend even to <i>allude</i> to the absolute claim of
our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span>, who, as the Son of Man, enjoyed
the gift of the Spirit without measure; who,
as very <span class="smcap">God</span>, "in the beginning created the Heaven
and the Earth,"&mdash;(for, "In the beginning was <span class="smcap">the
Word</span>; and <span class="smcap">the Word</span> was with <span class="smcap">God</span>; and <span class="smcap">the Word</span>
was <span class="smcap">God</span>.... All things were made by Him, and without
Him was not anything made that was made<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>:")&mdash;I
will not, I say, for every utterance of our <i><span class="smcap">Saviour
Christ</span></i> pause even, to claim the entire reverence of
our hearts,&mdash;the prostrate homage of our understandings.... Well
then. If we <i>can</i> but discover what
the mind and method of these several speakers and
writers was, with regard to the Interpretation of Holy
Scripture; on what principle, and with what sentiments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><i>they</i> bandied the Book of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Law; we
shall have discovered the thing of which we are in
search. For the <i>Author</i> of a book must perforce be
allowed to be the best judge of the method and intention
of that book:&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> <i>must</i> be allowed
to be the best authority as to His own meaning!</p>

<p>Now this method,&mdash;(of which, as I will presently
remind you, we possess a great many specimens,)&mdash;proves
to be very extraordinary. It altogether establishes
the fact that the Bible <i>is not to be interpreted
"like any other book."</i> That it <i>could</i> not be so interpreted,
might have been confidently anticipated beforehand,
from the very fact of its Divine origin<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>.
What I mean,&mdash;Since, "by the mouth of David,"
the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> is expressly declared by <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and
by St. Peter to have "spoken;" and since the Psalms
collectively are described by St. Paul as the utterance
of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>; since Jeremiah's witness is
said to be the witness of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>; and the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> is actually said to have spoken by
Isaiah; while the Spirit of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself, (St. Peter
says,) dwelt in the Prophets:&mdash;in a word, since
"holy men of <span class="smcap">God</span> spake <i>as they were moved by</i> the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>," and the provisions of the Mosaic Law
are to the same <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> by St. Paul emphatically
ascribed<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>;&mdash;stubborn <i>facts</i>, you are requested to observe,
which Essayists may prudently suppress but
which no Sophistry on earth can either evade or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>deny:&mdash;seeing, I say, that Holy Scripture is declared
by inspired men to be the utterance of the Eternal
God, it was to have been expected beforehand that
its texture would bear witness to its Divine origin;
and that, to interpret it "like any other book," would
be to forget its extraordinary character. Interpret
Sophocles and Plato, if you will, like any other book,
for a very plain reason; but beware how you apply
your purely human notions to the utterance of the
Ancient of Days; for that utterance, enshrined in one
particular volume, clearly makes that one volume essentially
unlike any other volume in the world.</p>

<p>You are particularly requested to observe, further,&mdash;that
singular pains have been taken to mystify this
entire subject. It has been a favourite device to multiply
difficulties,&mdash;real or imaginary,&mdash;and so, to create
a miserable sense of the dangers which fairly hem the
subject in,&mdash;in order to render more palatable a desperate
escape from them all. Thus, we are told of the
risks to which Grammatical nicety, and Rhetorical
accommodation expose us; and again, the snares into
which the Logical method may betray. Metaphysical
aid, we are assured, mystifies; and even Learning,
(would to Heaven we had a little more of it!) obscures
the sense<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>. Might we just take the liberty of suggesting
that the study of the exploded works of
German unbelievers, (of which Germany herself, thank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span><span class="smcap">God</span>! is beginning to be ashamed,) on the part of
men of very moderate intellectual powers, however
wise in their own conceit; and with no previous
Theological knowledge to guide them,&mdash;is another yet
more fruitful avenue to error?... Next, we are
threatened with the manifold inconveniences which
would ensue from the discovery that there is more
than one sense in Holy Scripture,&mdash;(<i>that</i> one sense
being assumed to be, <i>not</i> the sense intended by
its Divine Author, but the sense which the first
hearers may be supposed to have put upon it<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>.) "If
words may have more than one meaning," (it is not
very logically argued,) "they may have <i>any</i> meaning<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>."
We are told a great deal about "the growth
of ideas;" and of human prejudices; and of "the
disturbing influence of Theological terms."&mdash;But all
this kind of thing, it will be perceived at once, is
altogether foreign to the matter in hand. <i>Ought Scripture
to be interpreted like any other book,&mdash;or not? That</i>
is the real question! <i>Has Scripture only one meaning</i>,
or <i>more? That</i> is the point in dispute! Above all,
<i>What is the true principle of Scripture Interpretation?
That</i> is the only thing we have to discover!</p>

<p>Now, as for <i>how</i> the principles of Divine Interpretation
are to be discovered, it is undeniable that there
can be no surer way than by discovering <i>what is the
method of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span></i>; by inquiring, what is the
method of our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span>, and of His Evangelists,
and of His Apostles?</p>

<p>1. Surely it is needless to remind an audience like
the present, <i>what</i> that method is! Turn the first page
of St. Matthew's Gospel, and weigh well the three
famous cases of Interpretation which there encounter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>you<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>:&mdash;namely, the assurance that Hosea's words,
"Out of Egypt have I called my son<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>;"&mdash;that Jeremiah's
declaration concerning the tears of Rachel<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>;&mdash;and
that the many prophetic utterances concerning
"the Branch<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>;"&mdash;found fulfilment, each, in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.
The first,&mdash;when, at Jehovah's bidding, He was carried
up out of Egypt into Palestine; the second,&mdash;when the
bereaved mothers of Bethlehem wept for their murdered
offspring; the third,&mdash;when <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, being bred
up in Nazareth, was called a "Nazarene,"&mdash;the root of
which, etymologically, denotes "a branch."&mdash;But look
further, and your surprise will increase at discovering
how extraordinary the Divine method is. When our
Saviour cast out evil spirits and healed the sick,
St. Matthew declares that He fulfilled that prophecy
of Isaiah, "Himself took our infirmities and bare our
sicknesses<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>;" the language of the prophet in fact
being, "Surely He hath borne our <i>griefs</i> and carried
our <i>sorrows</i><a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>;" which, as far as the words go, is rather
a different thing.</p>

<p>2. But it is St. Paul who affords us the largest
induction of instances. When he would establish
the right of the Clergy to have due provision made
for them, he finds his warrant in a most unexpected
place of Scripture. "Say I these things as a man?
or saith not the Law the same also? For it is written
in the Law of Moses, 'Thou shalt not muzzle the
mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.' Doth
<span class="smcap">God</span> care for the oxen here alluded to<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>? (<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#956;&#8052; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#946;&#959;&#8182;&#957;
&#956;&#8051;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#920;&#949;&#8183;;) or saith He it altogether for our
sakes? <i>For our sakes</i>, no doubt, this is written<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>." I remind
you of the entire passage, because it is so very
express.&mdash;Elsewhere, St. Paul adduces a few verses
from the viiith Psalm, the primary and more obvious
meaning of which appears to assert nothing more than
the supremacy of Man's present nature over the inferior
races of animals; ("all sheep and oxen, yea and
all the beasts of the field<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>.") The application of it,
in a prophetic sense, to the supreme dominion of our
Redeemer over all created beings in Heaven and
Earth, is certainly not one which would naturally
suggest itself to us; yet is it for this purpose, and
this only, that St. Paul adduces it; and as confirmatory
of the universal sovereignty of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the
place in question is three times quoted by the same Apostle<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>.&mdash;Elsewhere,
when he would warn persons who
have been partakers of both Sacraments, of the danger
of final rejection, he cites the example of the Fathers
of Israel in the Wilderness. "The waters of the Red
Sea were a wall unto them, on their right hand and
on their left<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>," and the watery Cloud covered them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>above; whereby it came to pass that "all our Fathers
were under the Cloud, and all passed through the Sea;
and were all therefore <i>baptized</i> unto Moses in the
Cloud and in the Sea." Moreover, he declares that
they "did all eat the same spiritual meat;" (alluding
to the Manna;) "and did all drink the same spiritual
drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed
them: and <i>that Rock was <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i><a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>." ... Our
<span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> emphatic application to Himself (in the
vith of St. John) of the Manna, "the bread which
came down from Heaven,"&mdash;none can forget<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>.</p>

<p>3. But St. Paul further largely interprets the ordinances
of the Mosaic Law. Thus, the provision that
the High-priest alone should enter, once a year, into
the Holy of Holies, not without blood, he interprets
as follows;&mdash;"the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> this signifying,"&mdash;("the
<i><span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> this signifying!</i>)&mdash;that the way into
the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as
the first Tabernacle was yet standing<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>." He explains
further that "<span class="smcap">Christ</span> being come an High-Priest of
good things to come, by a greater and more perfect
Tabernacle, ... by His own Blood entered in once
into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal Redemption
for us<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>."&mdash;The Veil of the Temple, (he says,)
typified <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> flesh<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>; and St. Paul intimates that
he could further have spoken particularly of the Golden
Censer, and the Ark of the Covenant, and the Pot
of Manna, and Aaron's rod, and the Tables of the
Covenant, and the Cherubims of Glory<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.&mdash;Again, he
says, that "the bodies of those beasts whose blood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>is brought into the Sanctuary by the High Priest
for Sin, are burned without the camp. Wherefore
Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with
His own Blood, <i>suffered without the gate</i><a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>."&mdash;<i>Who</i>
is not familiar with the same Apostle's declaration
that the words of our father Adam relative to Marriage,
are expressive of a great mystery, and set
forth symbolically the union of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and His
Church; "For we are members of His Body,&mdash;of
His Flesh and of His Bones<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>?"&mdash;St. Peter is at least
as remarkable in his Interpretations as St. Paul; for
he says of the Ark "wherein eight souls were saved
by water,"&mdash;"The like figure whereunto, even Baptism,
doth also now save us<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>."</p>

<p>Now these samples of <i>Inspired Interpretation</i> would
be abundantly sufficient for our present purpose. But
before I proceed to make any use of them, it is right
to draw attention to a phenomenon, even more extraordinary.</p>

<p>4. It is found then, that besides vindicating for the
Scriptures of the Old Testament this unsuspected
depth and fulness of prophetic and typical meaning,
the very Narrative itself teems to overflowing with
mysterious purpose. You have but to weigh well
what the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> hath delivered concerning
Abraham and Melchizedek, Hagar and Sarah,&mdash;to
perceive that the texture of the Historical Narrative
itself is of supernatural fabric. All are familiar with
what I allude to; but I <i>must</i> remind you of it, in
detail. The Apostle is bent on shewing the superiority
of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> Priesthood to that of Aaron.
How does he proceed? He lays his finger, unhesitatingly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>on a verse in the cxth Psalm, ("Thou art
a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek;")&mdash;declares
with authority that it is <span class="smcap">Christ</span> whom the
prophet there alludes to,&mdash;or rather, whom <span class="smcap">God</span> apostrophizes,&mdash;(for
<i>that</i> is what St. Paul actually <i>says</i>;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166;<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>: although David undeniably
wrote the Psalm;)&mdash;and proceeds, without
more ado, to draw out minutely the characteristics of
our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> Priesthood, from the very brief narrative
contained in the xivth Chapter of Genesis. Do
but hear him!</p>

<p>The compound name "Melchi-zedek," being interpreted,
denotes "King of Righteousness:" while
"King of Salem" denotes "King of Peace." These
titles, (it is implied,) are emphatically appropriate to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> our King; to Him who "is our Righteousness,"
and the very "Prince of Peace." It happens
that nothing is said in Genesis about the parentage
of Melchizedek, nor about the family from which
he sprang: not a word as to when he was born, or
when he died. From this <i>silence</i> of Scripture, St. Paul
collects the typical adumbration of One who, as very
<span class="smcap">God</span>, was <i>without</i> human parentage,&mdash;had <i>no</i> earthly
lineage;&mdash;"was before all things," <span class="smcap">God</span> from all
eternity,&mdash;having <i>indeed</i> "neither beginning of days
nor end of life."&mdash;Did not Abraham give to Melchizedek
a tithe of the spoils? Consider then, (St. Paul
says,) how great an one Melchizedek must have been!
Nay, consider that the descendants of Levi are commanded
to take tithe of their brethren, although all
are sprung from Abraham alike; but here is one,
altogether of a different family, taking tithes of <i>Abraham</i>,&mdash;aye
and <i>blessing</i> Abraham too;&mdash;(&#948;&#949;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#954;&#949;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#951;&#954;&#949;, "<i>hath</i> tithed," "<i>hath</i> blessed,"&mdash;the effect
of the act <i>remaining</i> for ever in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> typified by
Melchizedek.)&mdash;This mysterious King of Salem and
Priest of the Most High <span class="smcap">God</span> not only tithes but
blesses Abraham, who had received from <span class="smcap">Almighty
God</span> the promises, which included all blessedness,
earthly and heavenly. Now, this implies Melchizedek's
superiority,&mdash;for, of course, the less is blessed
of the greater.&mdash;Men who receive tithe here below
are mortal; but the very silence of Scripture respecting
Melchizedek's death, symbolically teaches that
<span class="smcap">He</span> whom Melchizedek typified, yet liveth.&mdash;And indeed,
(so to speak,) the tribe of Levi who take tithes,
<i>paid</i> tithes to Melchizedek in the person of their great
progenitor; because Levi was as yet in the loins of
his father Abraham when Melchizedek met him<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>.... I
do not ask your pardon for thus leading you in detail
over one unusually minute specimen of Divine
Interpretation. I know well that there are many
persons to whom the Divine method is highly distasteful;
and who think their own method of Interpretation
infinitely better. But, unfortunately for
those persons, the question in hand is not a question
of taste, but a dry <i>matter of fact</i>. We have to discover
what is <i>the Divine method</i> of Interpretation, and no
other thing. Its improbability and its inconvenience,&mdash;its
difficulty, and its strangeness,&mdash;its seeming inconclusiveness,
(apart from the authority on which it
rests,) and its certain uniqueness, (notwithstanding
the many injunctions we have met with that we must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>interpret the Bible like any other book<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>,)&mdash;all these
considerations are all together irrelevant, and beside
the question. St. Paul himself admits that the Discourse
now before us is &#960;&#959;&#955;&#8058;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#8053;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#962;,&mdash;long
and of difficult interpretation<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>.&mdash;Some will perhaps
be found to inquire how it happens that while
so many remote points of analogy are adduced, so
obviously typical a circumstance as Melchizedek's
<i>bringing forth</i> "<i>bread and wine</i><a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>" obtains no notice
from the Apostle? I answer,&mdash;For the same reason
that Isaac is nowhere spoken of, nowhere so much as
hinted at, in the Bible, as being a type of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.
A blind man may see it. It requires no Revelation
from Heaven to teach such things as <i>that!</i> But the
typical foreshadowing of the superiority of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span>
Priesthood over that of Aaron, in the story of
Melchizedek, would infallibly have escaped mankind
altogether, unless it had been thus specially revealed.</p>

<p>Some there may be so utterly wanting in Theological
instinct, or so depraved of taste; so utterly
unused to the study of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word, or so unobservant
of the characteristic method of it,&mdash;as to imagine that
there is something trifling in the specimens of Interpretation
before us. I am only concerned to maintain
that they are Divine. You may think what you please
about them. They are the teaching of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>. Nay, if unfortunately any persons here present
should think themselves wiser than <span class="smcap">God</span>, I would
request them to observe that, singularly enough, <span class="smcap">God</span>
has connected with this very exposition a short address
<i>to themselves</i>. It runs as follows:&mdash;"Concerning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>Melchizedek, we have to deliver a long and difficult
interpretation; difficult, however, <i>only because
ye have become dull of hearing</i><a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>." (The fault, you observe,
is <i>yours</i>. Whereas <span class="smcap">God</span> made your spiritual
senses sharp and quick, you have blunted their edge,
and are become stupid and obtuse. It follows:)&mdash;"For
when, by reason of the length of time that ye
have professed Christianity, ye ought to be Teachers,"
(pray mark <i>that!</i>)&mdash;"ye have need that some one
should teach <i>you</i> the first Principles of the Oracles of
<span class="smcap">God</span>; and ye have become such as have need of milk,
and not of solid food. For every one that useth milk,
is without experience in the Word of Righteousness;
for he is an infant. But solid food (&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8048; &#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;)
is for them that are of full age<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>." Where you are
requested to observe that a specimen of Interpretation
<i>you</i> think trifling, the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> calls "<i>solid food</i>;"
and yourselves, who in your own conceit represent the
World's Manhood<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>, He calls &#957;&#951;&#960;&#8055;&#959;&#965;&#962;,&mdash;"<i>babes</i>." ... This
discrepancy of opinion strikes me as rather
curious.</p>

<p>5. The time would fail, were we to enter as particularly
into the Divine Interpretation elsewhere given
of another story, apparently as little fraught with
mystery as any in the Bible. <i>Who</i> would ever have
imagined that the brief narrative of Hagar's dismissal
from the house of Abraham at Sarah's instance, was
the &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#945; of so Divine a thing as St. Paul
declares;&mdash;the two Mothers setting forth the two
Covenants, (one, bearing children unto bondage,&mdash;the
other, the free Mother of us all: Sinai symbolized by
<i>that</i>, the heavenly Jerusalem by <i>this</i>:) and even Ishmael's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>mockery not being without mysterious meaning?&mdash;Such
however is the Divine Interpretation.&mdash;Elsewhere,
when St. Paul desires to contrast the method
of the Gospel with the method of the Law,&mdash;(<i>this</i>,
glorious; <i>that</i>, with the same glorious features
concealed;)&mdash;and also to illustrate the present unbelief
of the Jewish nation;&mdash;the Apostle finds a prophetic
emblem of their blindness in the veiled countenance
of their great Lawgiver, as described in the
xxxivth chapter of Exodus. The mystical intention
of that veil, (he says,) was to symbolize the nation's
inability to look steadfastly to the end of the dispensation,
and to recognize <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>. Nay, to this hour,
while they read their Scriptures, that veil (he says) is
upon their hearts. And yet, even as Moses, when
he returned to <span class="smcap">God</span>, is related to have taken off the
veil from his face, so (St. Paul says) will it fare with
the Jews, when <i>they</i> convert and turn themselves to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>. The veil will be withdrawn<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>.&mdash;Now, I gather
from all this, and many a hint of the like kind,&mdash;that
the whole of Scripture is of the same marvellous
texture, the Old Testament and the New, alike,&mdash;whether
we have the eyes to see it or not.</p>

<p>6. But I cannot dismiss the typical character of
the Scripture narrative, until I have reminded you of
one striking intimation of it which you might easily
overlook. "O fools and slow of heart," was our
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> reproof to Cleophas and his companion on
the evening of the first Easter: "Ought not <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>to have suffered these things, and to enter into His
Glory? And <i>beginning at Moses</i> and all the Prophets,
He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the
things concerning Himself<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>." In like manner, St.
Paul at Rome expounded to the unbelieving Jews,
"persuading them concerning <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> both <i>out of the
Law of Moses</i> and out of the Prophets, from morning
till evening<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>." The same thing is repeated elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>:
but the most express declaration is that of
our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself to the Jews:&mdash;"Had ye believed
Moses, ye would have believed Me; <i>for he wrote of
Me</i><a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>," Moses therefore <i>wrote concerning</i> <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself says so. But <i>where?</i> Shew me the
places in the Pentateuch which prove that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
was "to suffer these things" and then to "enter into
glory?" You cannot do it; unless indeed in Isaac's
Sacrifice you are content to find the adumbration of
the scene on Calvary. You cannot do it; unless in
Joseph's betrayal for twenty pieces of silver, (the deed
of another Judas!) and his letting down into the pit
without water, you recognize the image of the death
of One by the blood of whose Covenant the prisoners
of hope were set free<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>. You cannot do it; unless in
the same Joseph's exaltation to the supreme power of
Egypt, (when they "cried before him, Bow the
knee!") you behold <span class="smcap">Messiah's</span> session at the Right
Hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>. You cannot do it; unless you notice
how "Joseph, who was ordained to save his Brethren
from death, who would have slain <i>him</i>, did represent
the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, who was slain by us and yet dying
saved us<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>." You cannot do it; unless in the Paschal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>Lamb, and the wave-sheaf, you discern things Heavenly,
and of eternal moment. You cannot do it;
unless you remember "that as, in order to consecrate
the Harvest by offering to <span class="smcap">God</span> the first-fruits of it,
a sheaf was lifted up and waved; as well as a Lamb
offered on that day by the priest to <span class="smcap">God</span>; so <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>,
that immaculate Lamb which was to die, that Priest
which dying was to offer up Himself to <span class="smcap">God</span>, was
upon the same day lifted up and raised from the dead;
or rather shook and lifted up, and presented Himself
to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and so was accepted for us all; that so our
dust might be sanctified, our corruption hallowed, our
mortality consecrated to eternity." Many who hear
me will perceive that I have been quoting from Bp.
Pearson; and will be constrained to admit that Isaac
and Joseph,&mdash;the wave-sheaf and the Paschal Lamb,&mdash;may
well be types of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and that, thus lightly
touched, there can be little objection to tracing in
such histories and provisions of the Law, the main
outlines of the Life and Death and Resurrection of
our <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>. But remember, we have handled
wondrous little of the patriarchal History and of the
Law; and that little, wondrous cursorily; more, as
it seems to me, in the manner of children in a Sunday-school,
than as Divines in the first University of
Europe!... Now, <i>St. Paul</i> entertained <i>his</i> audience
"from morning until evening." Had he nothing to
say about Paradise, think you, and the mysterious
parallel between the first and second Adam? nothing
to say about the Ark of Noah, and the waters of the
Flood? What of the history of the patriarch Jacob,
and of Joseph "at the second time made known to his
brethren?" What of Moses, and the miracles of the
Exode? What of the many minute provisions, (all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>of them, no doubt, significant!) of the Mosaic Law?
What of Esau's posterity and Balaam's prophecies,&mdash;the
Cloud and the Flame,&mdash;the Manna and the Quails,&mdash;the
riven Rock and Jordan driven back?...</p>

<p>I have already said enough to feel at liberty to
gather out of it all, the two chief propositions concerning
Holy Scripture, which it is my business this
morning to establish. And first, I assert that it may be
regarded as a fundamental rule, that the Bible <i>is not
to be interpreted like any other book</i>. This I gather
infallibly from the plain fact, that <i>the inspired Writers
themselves</i> habitually interpret it <i>as no other book either
is, or can be interpreted</i>.</p>

<p>Next, I assert without fear of contradiction that
inspired Interpretation, whatever varieties of method
it may exhibit, is yet uniform and unequivocal in
this one result; namely, that it proves Holy Scripture
to be of far deeper significancy than at first sight
appears<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. By no imaginable artifice of Rhetoric or
sophistry of evasion,&mdash;by no possible vehemence of
denial or plausibility of counter assertion,&mdash;can it be
rendered probable that Scripture has invariably one
only meaning; and <i>that</i> meaning, the most obvious
and easy to those who first heard or read it.</p>

<p>I would not be misunderstood by this audience,
nor do I fear that I shall be. I am not denying
(<span class="smcap">God</span> forbid!) the literal sense of Scripture. Rather
am I, above all, contending for it. We may
<i>never</i> play tricks with the letter. Those Six Days
of Creation, depend upon it, were <i>six days</i>: and the
Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge, and the
Serpent, were the very things they are called,&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>no other things. So of every other part of the Bible.
The Temptation of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was as matter of fact
a transaction as one of His walks by the sea of Galilee.
<i>In what form</i> the Tempter came to Him, hath not
been revealed. <i>After what fashion</i> the Prince of the
power of the air contrived the dazzling panorama
"in a moment of time<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>," I do not pretend to understand.
The literal sense of what has been revealed,
is, for all that, to be depended on. All is sincere History:
<i>nothing</i> is ever allegory,&mdash;<i>nothing</i> may ever be
evacuated or explained away! We have our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
own word for it. The speech in Paradise, and what
happened at the time of the Flood; the fate of Lot's
wife, and what befel the cities of the plain; the conduct
of David (when he ate the shew-bread), and the
visit to Solomon of the Queen of Sheba; the history
of the widow of Sarepta, and of Naaman the Syrian:&mdash;all
these stories of the Old Testament are by our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself appealed to as veritable History<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>.</p>

<p>But I am proving that Scripture itself, literally
understood, compels us to believe that <i>under</i> the letter
of Scripture, (which <i>of course</i> is to be <i>interpreted</i> literally,)
there lies a deeper and sometimes a far less
obvious meaning; occasionally a meaning so improbable,
(as men account improbability,) that, but for
the finger of <span class="smcap">God</span> pointing it out, we could never by
possibility have discerned it; so extraordinary, that
when it is shewn us, it needs an effort of the heart
and of the mind to embrace it fully.</p>

<p>Cases of literal Interpretation are indeed of constant
occurrence in Scripture; but the principle on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>which they depend is obvious, and common to all
writings alike. I do not doubt, for a moment, that
the history of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, (which we
heard read this morning,) is a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> narrative,&mdash;<i>truer</i>
and <i>more</i> authentic in details, than is to be found
in any other book of History.&mdash;Neither do I doubt
that the obvious teaching, (the <i>moral</i> Interpretation as
it may be called,) of that incident, is the proper one:
viz. that even for the most fiery of fleshly trials, <span class="smcap">God's</span>
grace is sufficient:&mdash;that Joseph's safety lay in refusing
even to <i>be</i> with her, joined to his holy fear of
sinning <i>against <span class="smcap">God</span></i>:&mdash;that lust is ever cruel, and will
hunt for the precious life<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>:&mdash;finally, that the way of
purity, though it may lead at first to sorrow, will infallibly
conduct to blessedness at the last. Considerations
like these, which are obvious and easy, are
also unquestionably <i>true</i>; and especially precious,
(<i>who</i> ever doubted it?) as helps to personal holiness.&mdash;But
still, there may underlie this narrative, for
aught I see to the contrary, a mystical signification.
Potiphar's wife may, (as the best and wisest of ancient
and modern Divines have thought,) symbolize
the Power of Darkness; and Joseph, our Divine <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
The garment Joseph left in the woman's hand, may
represent that fleshly garment of which the true Joseph
divested Himself,&mdash;(&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#8049;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; as St. Paul speaks
in a very remarkable place,)&mdash;the mortal body which
Satan apprehended (his sole triumph!) and by which
he was ensnared, when a greater than Joseph gat Him
out from an adulterous world<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. Joseph in the prison,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>and <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in the grave: Joseph exalted, and <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
Ascended: Joseph at last feeding the families of the
World, and <span class="smcap">Christ</span> becoming the Bread of Life to all:&mdash;let
it not occasion offence, Brethren, if I confess
that, for aught I see to the contrary, some such hidden
teaching as this, may underlie the plain historical
narrative; and in no way interfere with a literal interpretation.</p>

<p>III. From the two foregoing negative positions,
however, (which almost need an apology, such obvious
truisms are they,) I eagerly pass on to something better
and higher.</p>

<p>1. And first, I boldly declare that the clue to all
that has been advanced concerning the marvellous
method of Holy Writ is supplied by the single consideration
that the Bible is <i>the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>,&mdash;that
Holy Scripture, from the Alpha to the Omega of it, is
the language of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>. Incomprehensible
and unmanageable on any other hypothesis,&mdash;all the
disclosures of inspired Interpretation, by the hearty
reception of this one revealed truth, are rendered perfectly
intelligible and clear. The <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> may
surely be assumed competent to interpret what the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> has already delivered! His disclosures
therefore are beyond the reach of censure; however
marvellous they may happen to be. But they are all
a hopeless riddle to those who have blinded their eyes
and hardened their hearts.</p>

<p>Thus, to advert for a moment to the prophetic character
(as it may be called) of the historical parts of
Scripture,&mdash;What is it which moves secret unbelief,
and prompts a reference to the human devices of Allegory
and Accommodation<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>? It is the profound conviction
that no merely human narrative could be handled
as St. Paul handles Genesis, except by indulging
in rhetorical license, and giving to Fancy a very free
rein. But disabuse your mind of this lurking suspicion,
so derogatory to the honour of Him by whose
Spirit the Bible is inspired,&mdash;cease to suspect that
the narrative of Scripture is a merely human narrative,&mdash;and
how different becomes the problem! Why
should the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> have spoken less by the
mouth of Moses, than by the mouth of David and
Isaiah, Jeremiah and the rest of the prophets? But
if <i>He</i> speaks in Genesis, then are the words of Genesis
<i>His</i>;&mdash;and every word of the narrative "<i>proceedeth</i>"
(as our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> phrases it,) "<i>out of the mouth of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>."</p>

<p>I am constrained to be thus express and emphatic,
because it has been lately "<i>laid down that Scripture
has one meaning</i>;&mdash;the meaning which it had to the
mind of the Prophet or Evangelist who first uttered
or wrote,&mdash;to the hearers or readers who first received
it<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>." The original sense of Scripture, (says this writer,)
is "the meaning of the words as they first struck
on the ears, or flashed before the eyes, of those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>heard and read them<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>." Now, I will not pause to
remark on the complicated fallacy involved in this.
For (1), Why should a hearer's first impression of a
speaker's meaning be assumed <i>to be</i> that speaker's
meaning<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>? And (2), Why may not Prophets and
Evangelists have <i>intended</i> secondary meanings<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>? But
I do not dwell on this, for it does not touch the point.
Let us hear the voice of one who adorned this place
many years before the present controversy arose, and
who has exactly anticipated the question now at issue.
"Observe how this matter really is," says Bp. Butler.
"If one knew a person to be <i>the sole Author</i> of a book;
and were certainly assured, or satisfied to any degree,
that one knew the whole of what he intended in it;
one should be assured or satisfied to such degree, that
one knew the whole meaning of that book: for <i>the
meaning of a book is nothing but the meaning of the Author</i>.
But if one knew a person to have compiled
a Book out of memoirs <i>which he received from Another,
of vastly superior knowledge in the subject of it</i>; especially
if it were a Book full of great intricacies and
difficulties; it would in no wise follow that one knew
the whole meaning of the Book, from knowing the
whole meaning of the compilers: for the original memoirs,
(i.e. the Author of them,) might have, (and
there would be no degree of presumption, in many
cases, against supposing Him to have,) some farther
meaning than the compiler saw. To say then, that
the Scriptures, and the things contained in them, can
have no other or farther meaning than those persons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>thought or had, who first recited or wrote them; is
evidently saying, <i>that those persons were the original,
proper, and sole authors of those books</i>, i.e. <span class="smcap">that they
are not inspired</span>: which is absurd, whilst the authority
of these books is under examination; i.e. till you
have determined they are of no divine authority at
all. Till this be determined, it must in all reason be
supposed,&mdash;not indeed that they <i>have</i>, (for this is
taking for granted that they are inspired;) but,&mdash;that
they <i>may</i> have, some farther meaning than what the
compilers saw or understood<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>."&mdash;So far Bp. Butler.</p>

<p>2. Now, if <span class="smcap">God</span> be in effect the Speaker, why need
we hesitate to believe that He has so framed the
stories, that they shall be throughout adumbrations
of the things which concern our peace<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>? Let some
garment be shewn me of merely human manufacture,
and however costly it may prove, I look for nothing
in it beyond the known properties of any other earthly
fabric. But give me the assurance that, on the contrary,
it was woven by Divine hands, and fashioned
in a Heavenly loom, and do I not straightway expect
to find it a mystery and a marvel of Art? It is even
so with the language of Holy Writ. It is all framed
and fashioned after a Diviner model than men are
able to imagine. It is instinct with sublimest meanings.
It is penetrated, through and through, with
the Spirit of the Most High <span class="smcap">God</span>. It is of so celestial
a texture, that, to the eye of the soundest Reason,
informed by the purest Faith, it reveals, (when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>Spirit of its Divine Author shines upon it,) the glorious
outlines of an imperishable Life!</p>

<p>3. The strong root of bitterness out of which springs
unbelief in this supernatural character of the historical
parts of the Bible, is an unworthy notion of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Power. Because <i>human</i> histories are perforce barren
and lifeless, it is assumed that the Book of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Law
must be a dead thing also. And then, the conceit of
self-relying Reason glides in, (like a serpent,) and
remonstrates as follows:&mdash;"Yea, can <span class="smcap">God</span> have sanctioned
a method of such subtlety and pliability as will
make His own Scriptures mean <i>anything</i><a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>? Is it not
rather, an exploded fashion, which the age has outgrown,&mdash;<i>that</i>
fashion of supposing that there is sometimes
a double sense in Prophecy, and that the Gospel
is symbolized in the Law? Were then the worthies
of the Old Testament puppets in <span class="smcap">God's</span> Hands, acting
parts?&mdash;now, typifying remote personages; now, exhibiting
future transactions; now, symbolizing national
events? Is it credible? Not so! Accept one
of two alternatives, and never dream of a third. Believe
either that the Evangelists, the Apostles, our
<span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span> Himself,&mdash;partaking of the ignorance
of their age, and speaking according to the modes of
thought then prevalent, were mistaken in their interpretations
of Holy Scripture; or else, deny boldly
that there are interpretations at all. Assume that
they are mere allegory and accommodation! Something
must be allowed for the backwardness of the
Past;&mdash;and 'the time has come when it is no longer
possible to ignore the results of criticism<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>.' A change
of method 'is not so much a matter of expediency as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>of necessity. The original meaning of Scripture' is
at last 'beginning to be understood<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>.' Be persuaded,
and make it thy business to persuade others, that the
Bible <i>is but a common Book!</i>"</p>

<p>4. To all of which, we make summary answer:&mdash;Passing
by thy self-congratulation on the enlightenment
of the age,&mdash;of which, except in certain departments
of physical Science, <i>we</i> see <i>no</i> evidence;&mdash;the
whole of thy argument concerning Holy Scripture
amounts to this;&mdash;that it would be very distasteful
<i>to thee</i>, to find that it contained any sense beyond
that which lies on the surface. Types, intended by
the Author of Scripture <i>to be</i> types: Prophecy with
sometimes more than a single application: historical
events foreshadowing remote transactions:&mdash;all these
<i>thou</i> deniest, because <i>thou</i> dislikest. Observe, however,
that while <i>thou</i> art urging thine own private
opinion, <i>we</i> are dealing with a revealed fact. <i>Thou</i>
talkest about a probability, but <i>we</i> are establishing
a proof. "It is written" that Scripture <i>is</i> thus significant,
<i>is</i> thus mysterious in its historical outlines.
And thou canst not explain away one syllable, though
thou shouldest deny "<i>every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>."</p>

<p>5. Let us, however, examine the question merely
by the light of unaided reason.&mdash;Consider then! If
<span class="smcap">God</span> made this world the particular kind of world
which He is found to have made it, in order that it
might in due time preach to mankind about Himself,
and about His providence:&mdash;if He contrived beforehand
the germination of seeds, the growth of plants,
the analogies of animal life; all, evidently, in order
that they might furnish illustrations of His teaching;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>and that so, great Nature's self might prove one vast
Parable in His Hands:&mdash;<i>why</i> may not the same <span class="smcap">God</span>,
by His Eternal Spirit, have so overruled the utterance
of the human agents whom He employed to write the
Bible, that their historical narratives, however little
their authors meant or suspected it, should embody
the outline of things heavenly; and, while they convey
a true picture of actual events, should <i>also</i> after
a most mysterious fashion, yield, in the Hands of His
own informing Spirit, celestial Doctrine also?</p>

<p>6. For let me remind you,&mdash;The very actions of men,&mdash;the
complicated transactions of our common lives,&mdash;are
thus overruled by God's Providence; and, without
restraint, are so controlled that they shall subserve to
the ulterior purposes of His will,&mdash;after a fashion which
altogether defies analysis. Beyond this inner circle
of comprehensible causation,&mdash;external to the immediate
sphere of cause and effect which courts our daily
scrutiny,&mdash;there is an outer circle, which rounds our
lives; and (as I said) overrules all we do; fashioning,
by virtue of a supreme fiat which is altogether
beyond our comprehension, all our ends. <i>Why</i> then,
I ask, may not the Bible be, what it purports to be,&mdash;the
authentic record of transactions which the marvellous
skill of Him who governeth all things in Heaven
and Earth did so overrule, that they should become
foreshadowings of chief transactions in the Kingdom
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>? Shall prophecy, in the ordinary sense
of the term, be admitted by all,&mdash;and yet a <i>prophetic
transaction</i> be deemed impossible with <span class="smcap">God</span>? If Isaiah
may prophesy of one "red in His apparel," after
"treading the winepress alone<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>;" may describe Him
as "despised and rejected of men;" "a Man of Sorrows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>and acquainted with grief;" "wounded for our transgressions
and bruised for our iniquities;" "brought
as a lamb to the slaughter," and "making intercession
for the transgressors;" and at last destined to find
"His grave with the wicked, yet with the rich in His
death<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>:"&mdash;if this may be <i>in words</i> described minutely,
and move no doubt; shall we close our eyes that we
may not see,&mdash;or seeing shall we fail to recognize,&mdash;in
the person of such an one as David, a divinely-intended
type of <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>? What! when he who was
born in Bethlehem, overcomes the Philistine at the
end of forty days, and takes from him the armour
wherein he trusted;&mdash;when he,&mdash;a prophet, priest,
and king,&mdash;is persecuted by his enemies, and betrayed
by his own familiar friend; when <i>he</i> at last passes
over the brook Kidron and ascends Olivet, sorrowing
as he goes;&mdash;yea, when he utters words which our
<span class="smcap">Redeemer</span> resyllables with <i>His</i> dying breath<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>;&mdash;wilt
thou refuse to discern in the person of David, the
lineaments of David's Son? and sneer at <i>us</i>, who
herein have been better taught than thou; although
thou hast no better reason to give for thy unbelief
than that the view of Holy Scripture which the
Church Catholic hath held in all ages, seems to thee
a thing impossible?</p>

<p>7. Take once more, if thou wilt, the analogy of
Nature; and thence infer what is <i>probable</i> concerning
things Divine. Is it observed that <i>the works</i> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
are thus single in their office; or are they, on the
contrary, manifold in their virtues and uses? Than
the metal Iron, what substance more serviceable for
every ordinary mechanical purpose of daily life? Yet,
ask the physician which of the metals <i>he</i> could least
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>afford to forego as an instrument of cure: and he will
tell thee that <i>he</i> finds Iron the fullest of healing virtues
also. Shall then plants and animals, yea, and the
whole of the Animal Kingdom, be admitted to subserve
to manifold, and at first sight unsuspected uses,&mdash;so
that the wisest are ready to confess that the
function of most remains to this hour a secret:&mdash;and
shall we be reluctant to allow that the <i>Word of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>&mdash;"the
Tree of Life," whereof "the leaves are for the
healing of the nations,"&mdash;may also be thus various in
its purpose; fraught with other teaching besides that
which on its very surface meets the careless eye?</p>

<p>8. To speak without a figure,&mdash;It is not of course
to be supposed that the inspired writers knew all the
wondrous qualities of the message they delivered, or
of the narrative they were divinely guided to indite.
Altogether a distinct question <i>this</i>; although the two
have been sometimes confused together<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. Nay, Revelation
itself comes in to help us here. St. Peter, in
express words, declares that concerning the mystery of
Redemption "the prophets <i>inquired and searched diligently</i>; ...
searching what, or what manner of time
the Spirit of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> which was in them did signify,
when it,"&mdash;(not <i>they</i>, observe, but <i>It</i>)&mdash;"testified
beforehand the sufferings of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and the glory
that should follow." That "not unto, themselves, but
unto <i>us</i> they did minister,"&mdash;thus much, indeed,
<i>was</i> revealed to them; but no more. The rest, to
this hour, the very "Angels desire to look into!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
9. But between the words which a man delivers
<i>being</i> full of Divine significancy, and <i>himself knowing</i>
the full scope and purport of those words,&mdash;there is
surely a mighty difference! When Caiaphas foretold
the universal efficacy of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> Death, <i>who</i> less than
Caiaphas suspected the far-reaching truth of the words
which fell from his unholy lips? <i>He</i> knew nothing
about the triumphs of the Cross; and yet he could
prophesy very accurately concerning them. "This
spake he not of himself," (says the Evangelist,) "but
being high-priest that year, he prophesied that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
should die for that nation; and not for that nation
only, but that also He should gather together in one
the children of <span class="smcap">God</span> that were scattered abroad<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>." ...
It may safely be assumed that the sacred writers no
more knew the force and power of their own words,
than those Priests who lived and moved amid the
shadows of the Mosaic Ritual were able to discern
therein, the substance of things eternal in the Heavens.
And yet we believe concerning those ritual types that
"they were a concealed prophetic evidence, the force
of which was made apparent by the presence of the
Gospel<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>." I am prone to suspect that the burning
vehemence of their own language must many a time
have moved the Prophets of old to deepest astonishment;
and that when there broke from them words of
more than mortal power,&mdash;or images of unearthly
grandeur,&mdash;or the outlines of a grief more than human;
when they spake of a betrayal for thirty pieces
of silver<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>, of blows and spitting<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>, and of pierced
hands and feet<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>; of parted garments and lots cast upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>a vesture<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>;&mdash;they must have felt, they must have felt
the awfulness of the message they were commissioned
to deliver; and longed, yea yearned unutterably to
see and to hear the things which were reserved to be
witnessed in the days of the Son of Man!</p>

<p>10. Enough, however, of all this. In reply to <i>&agrave;
priori</i> objections, I have been content to argue the
question as if the Bible were a newly-discovered Book
without a history; whereas the consentient writings
of all the Fathers and Doctors of every age, in every
portion of the Christian Church, is an overwhelming
<i>fact</i>! Rather have I reasoned as if the Bible were
a book altogether silent concerning itself. But the
plain truth, as I have fully shewn, is the very reverse.
Scripture is <i>full</i> of interpretations of Scripture;&mdash;and
the constant method of Scripture in such interpretations,
is spiritual or mystical;&mdash;and this witness of
Scripture is the strongest proof possible that the principle
involved is correct. Meanwhile, the great underlying
truth which I now desire, more than any other
to bring before you, is this:&mdash;that it is the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span> who, in the New Testament, interprets what
the same <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> had delivered in the Old. This,
believe me, is the true key, the only intelligible solution,
to all those difficulties respecting places of the
Old Testament, whether interpreted, or only quoted,
in the New, which have so exercised the ingenuity of
learned men. We are always to remember, in a word,
that the <i>true</i> Author of either Testament,&mdash;the <i>real</i>
Author of every part of the Bible, is (not Man, but)
<span class="smcap">God</span>!</p>

<p>IV. Such then, (to conclude,) is <i>the Divine method
of Interpretation</i>. We are not concerned now to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>classify, and sort it out under different heads. <i>To
apply</i>, even to a small extent, the principles we have
been labouring to establish, would not only lead us
much too far, but would constrain us to travel out of
our proper subject and prescribed province. Our purpose
has only been, to vindicate the profundity, or
rather <i>the fulness</i> of Holy Writ<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>; and to shew that
under the obvious and literal meaning of the words,
there lies concealed a more recondite, and a profounder
sense: call that sense mystical, or spiritual, or Christian,
or what you will. Unerringly to elicit that
hidden sense is the sublime privilege of inspired
Writers; and they do it by allusion, by quotation, by
the importation of a short phrase<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>, by the adoption of
a single word<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>,&mdash;to an extent which no one would
suspect who had not carefully studied the subject.
How that method of theirs is to be <i>applied by ourselves</i>,
it is impossible, I repeat, for me even to hint at in
a single discourse. But <i>this</i>, I will say; and with <i>this</i>
I dismiss the subject;&mdash;that Interpretation would be
a hopeless task, but for the solemn circumstance that
the whole of the Bible is inspired by one and the self-same
Spirit; so that one part may always be safely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>compared with any other part of it, you please. Nay,
by no other method can you hope to understand the
Bible, than by such a laborious comparison of its
several parts. "Non nisi ex Scriptur&acirc; Scripturam
potes interpretari." The more you study the Book,
the more you will feel convinced that its many authors
all resorted to one and the same Fountain of Inspiration.
They all use the same imagery; they all
speak the same language; they all mean the same
thing. St. John the Divine, in the Book of Revelation,
shuts up the Canon by reproducing the combined
imagery of all the ancient prophets,&mdash;by declaring
that the Song of Moses and of the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span> is
sung by the redeemed in Heaven,&mdash;by marvellous
words about "the Tree of Life," which is "in the
midst of the Paradise of <span class="smcap">God</span>." The Inspired writers
of either Testament all draw from the same Treasury,
and therefore all say the same things. The Heavenly
Jerusalem, (with her gates of pearl and streets of gold,)
is the home of the spirit of each one of them<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>; <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>, and He Crucified, is the abiding theme of
them all. And O, how their words do sometimes
teem, and their phrases swell, almost to bursting,
with their blessed argument<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>! You shall be troubled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>with only one example of what I mean.&mdash;Moses
having described the interview between Melchizedek
and Abraham, the mighty secret of <span class="smcap">Messiah's</span> priesthood
which therein lay enshrined was curtained all
so close, that neither Angels nor Men could possibly
discern it. Must it then remain a mystery for
2000 years? Not so! Midway between the day of
Abraham and the day of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;just midway,&mdash;David,
speaking by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>,&mdash;(of <i>that</i>, our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself assures us<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>,)&mdash;David, I say, when a
thousand years had rolled by, utters the cxth Psalm;
and in the fulness of his prophetic fervour, the great
secret bursts unexpectedly into light! A thousand
years had passed since Abraham returned from 'the
slaughter of the Kings.' It wanted yet a thousand
years to the date of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> Birth. And lo,
midway, a voice is heard, shouting to Him across the
gulf of Ages,&mdash;"<i>Thou</i> art a Priest for ever <i>after
the order of Melchizedek</i>!"</p>

<p>"And let not Reason be alarmed. Her vocation is
not gone. Yea rather, I know not if Human Intellect
ever had a loftier problem presented to her than
to follow out that deep Analogy which has been
noticed above; and to learn, (if it may be called
Reason's learning,) how to deal with Holy Scripture
as Apostles and Evangelists deal with it. Let not
Reason be alarmed. She is only asked to listen, and
to discern the nature and laws of Sacred Study. She
is asked but to discern the evidence which there is of
her being in a world which she imperfectly understands....
The student of the Bible is advised so to
address himself to the study of that Book, so to deal
with its language, as one should deal with <span class="smcap">the Word</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span><span class="smcap">of God</span>,&mdash;the measure of whose import is in the
infinite, not in the finite World.&mdash;Surely, by these
things the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> tries the spirits of us all; tries other
men by other means, but tries the intellectual man by
the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>, and watches him as he reads it;
hardens the obdurate; blinds the self-blinded; but
pours into the humble mind the riches of His divine
Wisdom like showers into a valley; making
it soft with the drops of rain and blessing the increase
of it<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>."</p>

<p>V. Friends and brethren, it is not without reluctance
that on a Sunday in Lent, when penitential
thoughts should rather occupy us,&mdash;and in this place
too, where the promotion of practical piety should
rather be our aim,&mdash;I have so addressed you. But
indeed, I seem to have no choice. It is idle crying
"peace, peace," when there is <i>no</i> peace. If the Inspiration
of Holy Scripture be a deceit, and the Divine
meaning of Holy Scripture a superstition,&mdash;then, farewell
to all our hopes in Life and in Death; farewell
to peace in days of despondency and gloom. Our
faith is gone, and our teaching becomes a hollow heartless
thing. Since, under the name of freedom of discussion,
unbounded licentiousness of speculation is
openly the fashion of the age, we are constrained to
give a reason for the hope which is in us; and to defend,
without compromise or hesitation, that Bible,
which is the great bulwark of the Faith. It shall not
be said that we can condemn, but that we make no
answer. It must be seen that we put forth in reply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>the ancient Truths; and it will be felt that before the
majesty of those ancient Truths, the arts of the enemy
will prove weak and unavailing,&mdash;rather, will stand
revealed in all their native deformity. If English
Clergymen, coming abroad in the cast-off clothes of
German unbelief<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>, and decked out with the exploded
sophisms of the last century, are to declare openly
that the faith of our Fathers is already looked upon
among ourselves as 'a kind of fossil of the Past,'&mdash;then
is it high time that voices should be heard vindicating
<i>that</i> ancient method of our Fathers; and boldly proclaiming
that this imputation against the Clergy of
England is a disreputable untruth. The Church of
England, (<span class="smcap">God</span> be praised!) hath <i>not</i> left her first love;
hath <i>not</i> given up her ancient method; Christianity is
<i>not</i> 'a difficulty to the highest minds.' The Christian
Religion embraces, as much as ever it did, "the
thought of men upon the Earth." "All the tendencies
of Knowledge" are <i>not</i> "opposed to it." The
Gospel is still immeasurably before the age. Intellect
has not gone,&mdash;the loftiest order of well-trained intellects
will never go,&mdash;the other way<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>. It is, on the
contrary, none but a very shallow wit which errs.
Had it confined its speculations to the cloister, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>come abroad with sorrow and shame, we should have
pitied in silence, and in silence also have lamented.
But when it comes insultingly abroad, and sets up
a claim to intellectual superiority even while it denies
the most sacred truths;&mdash;<i>then</i> pity gives way before
indignation and disgust. Crown the whole with the
iniquity of imputing these views generally to the
more thoughtful of the English Clergy<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>,&mdash;and we are
constrained openly to resent the grievous wrong. We
declare it to be an unfounded calumny; a calumny
which, in the name of the whole Church, I solemnly
repel before <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;and His Holy Angels,&mdash;and <i>you</i>!</p>

<p>Vain, utterly vain,&mdash;worthless, utterly worthless,&mdash;must
any superstructure of intellectual, moral, or religious
training be, which is built up on the doctrine
that the Bible is to be interpreted like any other
Book; in other words, that the Bible <i>is</i> a common
Book; in other words, that <i>Inspiration is a fable and
a dream</i>. We have no fear whatever that <i>your</i> high
instincts, (with all your faults!),&mdash;<i>your</i> English manliness,&mdash;will,
to any extent be led astray, by sophistry
worthless as that which we have been exposing.
But we know you look to your appointed Teachers
from this place, (as well you may,) for advice, and
support, and encouragement, in your better aspirations;&mdash;and
let <i>me</i>, at least, in plain language, warn
you that novelties in Religion never <i>can</i> be true.
"Philosophia," says the great Bishop Pearson speaking
of Physical Science; "Philosophia quotidie progressu:
Theologia nisi <i>regressu</i> non crescit<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>." "Ask
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>for the old paths!" ... The faith, remember, was
&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;,&mdash;<i>once for all</i>,&mdash;delivered to the Saints. There
will be no new deposit. There can be no new
doctrines. There has been no fresh Revelation,&mdash;no
new principle of guidance vouchsafed to man.
A new method of interpreting Scripture is <i>quite</i>
impossible. And the true method,&mdash;the only <i>true</i>
method&mdash;<i>must</i> be that which was adopted by our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, by His Evangelists, and by His Apostles:
a method which <i>they</i> taught to their first disciples,
and which those early Bishops and Doctors handed
on in turn to the generation which came after them.
That method, by <span class="smcap">God's</span> great goodness, has descended
in an unbroken stream, even to ourselves; who have
described it this morning, feebly indeed and unworthily,&mdash;yet,
in the main, as it would have been described
at <i>any</i> time, by <i>any</i> of the glorious company
of the Apostles, the goodly fellowship of the Prophets,
the noble army of Martyrs,&mdash;by any of the Doctors
and Fathers of the Holy Church throughout the
world! O let it be our great concern,&mdash;yours and
mine,&mdash;to preserve with undiminished lustre the whole
deposit of Heaven-descended teaching which is the
Church's treasure!... Like runners in a certain
ancient race of which we all have read, let it be <i>our</i>
pride and joy,&mdash;yours and mine,&mdash;to grasp the torch
of Truth with a strong unwavering hand; to run joyously
with it so long as the days of this earthly race shall
last; and dying, to hand it on to another, who, with
strength renewed like the eagle's, may again,&mdash;swiftly,
steadily, exultingly,&mdash;run with it, till he fails!... <i>So</i>,
when the Judge of quick and dead appeareth,&mdash;<i>so</i> let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>Him find <i>you</i> occupied,&mdash;O young men, (many of you,
my friends,) who are already the hope of half the English
Church! So faithfully may <i>we</i>, Brethren and
Fathers, one and all, be found employed, when He
cometh,&mdash;whose answer to the Tempter is emphatically
<i>the</i> text of the present solemn season, as well as
a mighty voucher for the Divine origin, and sustaining
efficacy of that Book concerning which I have
been detaining you so long,&mdash;"It is written, Man
shall not live by bread alone; but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of <span class="smcap">God</span>!"</p>

not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven?'
(that is, to bring <span class="smcap">Christ</span> down from above:) or, 'Who shall

<p>It is quite marvellous in how many different ways
different classes of professing Christians have contrived
to nullify the value of their admission that the
Bible is <i>inspired</i>. Some would distinguish the inspiration
of the Historical Book from that of those which
we call Prophetical. Others profess to lay their finger
on what are <i>the proper subjects</i> of Inspiration, and what
are not. Some are for a general superintending guidance
which yet did not effectually guide; while others
represent the sacred Writers as subject, in what they
delivered, to the conditions of knowledge in the age
where their lot was cast. The view of Inspiration which
Scripture itself gives us,&mdash;namely, that God <i>is therein
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>speaking by human lips</i><a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>; so that 'holy men of <span class="smcap">God</span>'
delivered themselves as they were 'impelled,' 'borne
along,' or 'lifted up,' (&#966;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;) <i>by the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span></i><a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>;&mdash;<i>this</i> plain account of the matter, I say, which converts
'all Scripture' into something '<i>breathed into by
<span class="smcap">God</span></i>,' (&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;,)<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>&mdash;men are singularly slow to
acknowledge. The methods which they have devised
in order to escape from so plain a revealed Truth,
are 'Legion.'</p>

<p>Second to none of the enemies of Holy Writ, practically,
are they who deny its depth and fulness. It
is only another, and a more ingenious way, of denying
the Inspiration of the Bible, to evacuate its more mysterious
statements. Those who are for eluding the
secondary intention of Prophecy, the obviously mystical
teaching of Types, the allegorical character of
many a sacred Narrative,&mdash;are no less dangerous enemies
of <span class="smcap">God</span>'s Word than those who frame unworthy
theories in order to dwarf Inspiration to the standard
of their own conceptions of its nature and office. I
say, it is only another way of denying the Inspiration
of Scripture, to deny what is sometimes called its
mystical, sometimes its typical, sometimes its allegorical
sense.... And thus,&mdash;what with the arbitrary
decrees of our own unsupported opinion, or the self-sufficient
exercise of our own supposed discernment;&mdash;what
with our insolent mistrust; or our shortsighted
folly and presumption; or, lastly, our coldness
and deadness of heart,&mdash;our slender appetite
for Divine things, which makes us yearn back after
Earth, at the very open gate of Heaven;&mdash;in one way
or other, I repeat, we contrive to evacuate our own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>admission that the Bible is an inspired Book: we
fasten discredit on its every page: we become profane
men, like Esau: we despise our birthright.</p>

<p>But the most subtle enemy of all remains yet to
be noticed. It is he, who,&mdash;finding the plain Word
of <span class="smcap">God</span> against him: finding himself refuted in his
endeavour to fix one intention only on the words of
the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, and <i>that</i> intention, the most obvious
and literal one; finding himself refuted even by the
express revelation of the same <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, elsewhere
delivered;&mdash;bends himself straightway to resist,
and explain away, that later revelation of what was
the earlier meaning. It is a marvellous thing but so
it is, that the very man who contended so stoutly a
moment ago for the literal meaning of Scripture, <i>now</i>
refuses, and denies it. Anything but <i>that</i>! If he
allows that St. Matthew, or St. Paul,&mdash;yea, or even
our Blessed <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself,&mdash;are to be <i>literally</i> understood;
are severally to be taken to <i>mean</i> what they
<i>say</i>;&mdash;then, Moses and David,&mdash;narrative, law, and
psalm,&mdash;besides their literal meaning, have, at least
<i>sometimes</i>,&mdash;and they <i>may</i> have <i>always</i>,&mdash;a mystical
meaning also. <i>Under</i> the evident, palpable signification
of the words, there lies concealed something
grander, and deeper, and broader; high as Heaven,&mdash;deep
as Hell.</p>

<p>And this supposition is so monstrous an one; seems
so derogatory to their notions of the mind of <span class="smcap">God</span>;&mdash;it
is deemed so improbable a thing, that the words
of Him, whose ways are not like Man's ways, should
span the present and the future, at a grasp;&mdash;that He
whose "thoughts are very deep," should, with language
thereto corresponding, be setting forth <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
and His Redemption, while He tells of Patriarchs and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>Lawgivers,&mdash;Judges and Kings,&mdash;priests and prophets
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:&mdash;I say, it is deemed so incredible
a thing that Moses should have written concerning
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, (though our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span> Himself declares
that Moses did write concerning Him)<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>; or that the
occasional expressions of the Prophets should really
contain the far-reaching allusions which in the New
Testament are assigned to them; that the men I
speak of,&mdash;men of learning (sometimes), and of piety
too,&mdash;will condescend to every imaginable artifice in
order to escape the cogency of the Divine statement.
St. Paul&mdash;was infected with the Hebrew method of
interpretation. (It is of course <i>assumed</i> that this
method was essentially erroneous! It is overlooked
that our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had recourse to it, as well as St. Paul!
It is either forgotten, or denied, that the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>,
speaking by the mouth of St. Paul, acquiesced in
every instance of such interpretation on the part of
His chosen vessel!) ... As for St. Matthew, he
addressed his Gospel to the Jews, and therefore reasoned
as a Jew would. (St. Matthew's Gospel was
not of course intended for the Christian Church!
The blessed Evangelist was also deeply learned,&mdash;it is
of course reasonable to suppose,&mdash;in the sacred hermeneutics
of the Hebrew Schools!) ... The other
Sacred Writers, it is pretended, all wrote according
to the prejudices of the age in which they lived.&mdash;In
all these cases, it is contended that <i>merely in the way
of Accommodation</i>, is the language of the Old Testament
cited in the New. What was said of one thing
is transferred to quite another,&mdash;to suit the purpose
of the later writer; to illustrate his reasoning, to
adorn or to enforce his statements.... And this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>brings me to a question of so much importance, that
I pause to make a few remarks upon it. In the present
discourse, it shall suffice to remark on the doctrine
of <i>Scriptural</i> <span class="smcap">Accommodation</span>; for which it is
presumed that the text, (selected not without reference
to the present Sacred Season,) affords ample
scope, as well as supplies a fair occasion.</p>

<p>Now, it is not to the <i>term</i> "Accommodation," that
we entertain any dislike; but to the <i>notion</i> which it
seems intended to convey; and to the <i>principle</i> which
we believe that it actually embodies. That the <span class="smcap">Holy
Spirit</span> in the New Testament sometimes accommodates
to His purpose a quotation in the Old,&mdash;is very
often a mere matter of fact. In all those places, for
instance, where St. Paul inverts the clauses of a place
cited,&mdash;there is a manifest accommodation of Scripture,
in the strictest sense of the word. When two,
three, or more texts, widely disconnected in the Old
Testament, are continuously exhibited in the New,&mdash;a
species of accommodation has, of course, been employed.
The same may be said when a change of
construction is discoverable. Again, there is accommodation,
of course, when narrative,&mdash;legal enactment,&mdash;or
prophecy, is <i>so exhibited</i> that the point of
its hidden teaching shall become apparent. Nay, in
a certain sense of the word, there is "accommodation,"
as often as a prophecy, however plain, is applied to
the historical event which it purports to foretel. The
prophecy may be said,&mdash;(with no great propriety indeed,
but still, intelligibly,)&mdash;to have been accommodated
to its fulfilment.&mdash;Occasionally, a general promise
is made particular,&mdash;as in Hebrews xiii. 6; and
perhaps <i>this</i> might be called an accommodation of the
text to the needs of an individual believer. Yet is it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>plain that in all these cases '<i>application</i>' or '<i>adaptation</i>'
would be a better word.</p>

<p>But such ways of adducing Holy Scripture, we
suspect, are not by any means what is <i>meant</i> by 'Accommodation;'
and they do not certainly correspond
with the notion which the term is calculated to convey.
The place in the Old Covenant, seems, (from
the term employed,) to have been forced, against its
conscience, as it were, to bear witness in behalf of the
New. It has been wrenched away from its natural
bearing and intention; and made to accommodate itself,&mdash;and,
on the part of the writer, quite arbitrarily,&mdash;to
a purpose, with which it has, in reality, no manner
of connexion. This, I say, is the notion which
the term "Accommodation" seems to convey.</p>

<p>I am supposing, of course,&mdash;(as the opposite school
is, of course, supposing,)&mdash;<i>not</i> an <i>illustration</i>,&mdash;which
obviously <i>any</i> writer, whether ordinary or inspired,
has a right to introduce at will; but a case where the
cogency of the argument depends entirely on the place
cited. A sudden and unforeseen requirement arose;&mdash;nothing
entirely fit and applicable occurred to the
memory: but by an arbitrary handling of the ancient
Oracles of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;(altogether illogical and inconclusive
indeed, yet entitled to a certain measure of respectful
consideration at our hands, and certainly having a
strong claim on our indulgence,)&mdash;the later writer saw
that he should be able to substantiate his position, or
to strengthen his argument, or to prove his point.
And he did not hesitate to do so. It is surprising that
his hearers or his readers should have accepted his
statements, and admitted his reasoning;&mdash;very! But
they <i>did</i>. And it is for us, the heirs of the wisdom
of all the ages, to detect the time-honoured fallacy and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>to expose it.&mdash;This, I say, is the notion which the
term "Accommodation" seems calculated to convey;
and it is to be feared, <i>does</i> very often represent.</p>

<p>And the introduction of this principle, as already
explained, I cannot but regard as the most insidious
device of all. It admits fully all that we have elsewhere
laboured to establish. It freely grants that
Apostles and Evangelists were inspired. But then,
it denies that much of what they deliver in the way
of interpretation of Scripture, is to be regarded as <i>real</i>
interpretation. By a taste for Allegory; by Rhetorical
license; on <i>any</i> principle, it seems, <i>but one</i>, is
the Divine method to be accounted for; and the plain
facts of the case to be obscured, or explained away.</p>

<p>Now I <i>altogether reject</i> this principle of arbitrary
"Accommodation." I hold it to be a mere dream and
delusion. And I reject it on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It is evidently a mere excuse for Human ignorance,&mdash;a
transparent deceit. Men do not see how to
explain, or account for, the apparent license of the
Divine method; and so they have invented this method
of escape. Most cordially do I subscribe to the
opinion expressed by Bishop Bull, in his discussion of
the very text which we are now about to consider:&mdash;"Atque,
ut verum fatear, semper existimavi, allusiones
istas, (ad quas confugiunt quidam tanquam ad
sacrum su&aelig; ignoranti&aelig; asylum,) plerumque aliud nihil
esse, quam sacr&aelig; Scriptur&aelig; abusiones manifestas<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>."</p>

<p>2. The "theory of Accommodation," (as it is called,)
is attended with this fatal inconvenience,&mdash;that, (like
certain other expedients which have been invented to
get over difficulties in Religion,) it altogether fails of
its object. For even if we should grant, (for argument's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>sake,) that some quotations from the Old Testament
<i>can</i> be explained on this principle,&mdash;so long as
there remain others which defy it altogether, nothing
is gained by the proposed expedient. Thus, so long
as attention is directed to certain of the places in St.
Paul's writings already referred to<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>, there is certainly
<i>no absurdity</i> in adducing them as instances of Rhetorical
license. But how can it be pretended that the
text whereby St. Paul establishes, (on two distinct
occasions,) the right of the Christian Ministry to a
liberal maintenance,&mdash;with what propriety can it be
thought that Deut. xxv. 4 lends itself to such a theory?
Those words <i>seem</i>,&mdash;and, apart from Revelation, might
without hesitation have been declared,&mdash;to have <i>nothing
at all to do with the matter</i><a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>! To talk of the
"accommodation" of words so eminently unaccommodating,
is unreasonable, and even absurd.</p>

<p>3. But, allowing the advocates of this theory all
they can possibly require, the result of their endeavours
is but to make the Sacred writers ridiculous
after all. For it attributes to them a method, which, if
it be a <i>mere</i> exhibition of human fancy, often seems
to be but a species of ingenious trifling,&mdash;scarcely entitled
to serious attention at our hands. There is no
alternative, in short, between certain of the expositions
which we meet with, being Divine,&mdash;and
therefore worthy of all acceptation; or Human,&mdash;and
therefore entitled to no absolute deference
whatever.</p>

<p>4. On the other hand, learned research has hitherto
invariably tended to shew that the meaning claimed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>for Scripture by an Apostle or Evangelist, <i>does</i> actually
exist there. Thus, it has been admirably demonstrated
that the Evangelical meaning attributed by
St. Matthew, (in the first chapters of his Gospel,) to
certain places in the ancient Prophetical Scriptures of
the Jewish people, derives nothing but corroboration
from the inquiries of Piety and Learning<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.... It is
proposed on the present occasion, without pretending
to bring to the question any such helps as these, to
examine the portion of Holy Scripture already under
our notice, with a view to ascertaining what light it
will throw on the main question at issue. To this
task, I now address myself.</p>

<p>St. Paul's words, from the 6th to the 9th verse (inclusive)
of the xth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans,
present probably, as fair an example as could be
desired of what is sometimes called "Accommodation."
To say the truth, I know not an instance of what, <i>in
any uninspired writing</i>, I should have been myself more
inclined to stigmatize as such. The Apostle begins
an affectionate remonstrance with his countrymen by
declaring that they "did not understand the Righteousness
of <span class="smcap">God</span>;" (that is, the Divine method whereby
<span class="smcap">God</span> wills that we shall be made righteous, by faith
<i>in <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i>;) but desired to set up (&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953;) a righteousness
of their own, on the worthless foundation of their
own Works<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>. "For," (he proceeds; with plain reference
to <i>what</i> "the Righteousness of <span class="smcap">God</span>" <i>is</i>;)&mdash;"<i>For</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span><span class="smcap">Christ</span> is the end" (aim, or object,) "of the Law<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> to
every one who hath faith" in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. St. Paul straightway
proceeds, (as his manner is,) to establish this
latter proposition. How does he do it? "<i>For</i>," (he
begins again,)&mdash;"Moses describes the nature of the
righteousness which proceeds from the Law, when
he declares [in Leviticus xviii. 5,] that '<i>The man who
hath done</i> the deeds commanded by the Law, shall live
thereby.'&mdash;But concerning the Righteousness which
proceeds from Faith,"&mdash;[it was called before, 'the
Righteousness of <span class="smcap">God</span>,']&mdash;"Moses writes as follows<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>:&mdash;'Say
not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into
Heaven? (that is, to bring <span class="smcap">Christ</span> down:) or, Who
shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
up from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is
nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is,
the word of faith, which we preach: because if thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, and
shalt believe in thine heart that <span class="smcap">God</span> raised Him from
the dead, thou shalt be saved."</p>

<p>Here then is a quotation from the xxxth chapter of
the Book of Deuteronomy,&mdash;a quotation introduced in
the way of argument, in support of a proposition: the
remarkable circumstance being, that St. Paul adduces
the words of Moses with extraordinary license. For
first, he omits as many of the Prophet's words as
make little for his purpose, while he introduces a very
remarkable alteration in some of the words which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>retains: amounting to a substitution of one sentence
for another. And next, there is one single word, which
he expands into an important phrase; and <i>that</i> merely
to suit his own argument. But the strangest thing
of all is the interpretation which he delivers of
words, which as we have just seen, are partly his
own,&mdash;partly, the words of Moses: by which interpretation,
the most strikingly <i>Christian</i> character is
fastened upon sayings pronounced by the ancient Lawgiver
in the land of Moab, to the Jewish people.&mdash;We
do further, for our own part, most freely admit,
that the place,&mdash;as it stands in the Old Testament,&mdash;neither
at first, nor at second sight, seems to have any
such meaning as the Apostle assigns to it. I will remind
you of the words in Deuteronomy, by reading
the entire passage:&mdash;"This commandment which I
command thee this day, ... is not hidden from thee,
neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to Heaven, and
bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say,
Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very
nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that
thou mayest do it." ... Now, I say, one of ourselves
might read this passage in the Book of Deuteronomy
over a hundred times, and never suspect that Moses,
when he so wrote, was writing concerning faith in
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>: and yet we have the sure testimony of the
<span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> to the fact that he <i>was</i>.&mdash;The inquiry,
"Who shall ascend into Heaven?", signifies, we are
told, "Who shall ascend,&mdash;<i>to bring down <span class="smcap">Christ</span> from
above</i>?"&mdash;And just so, the other clause, "Who shall
descend into the deep?", is declared to be an incom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>plete
expression: the full phrase being,&mdash;"Who shall
descend,&mdash;<i>to bring up <span class="smcap">Christ</span><a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> from the dead</i>." ...
Now we never desire to see a non-natural sense fastened
on the Inspired Word. With Hooker, we "hold it for
a most infallible rule in expositions of sacred Scripture,
that, where a literal construction will stand, the
furthest from the letter is commonly the worst." We
contend therefore that whereas we have here the explicit
assurance that Moses wrote of none other than
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;though his words do not bear upon them
any evidence of the fact,&mdash;it is a mere trifling with
holy things, to call the fact in question.</p>

<p>Here, however, we shall be reminded that the great
Apostle,&mdash;though professing to quote,&mdash;confessedly
argues in part from <i>his</i> own language, which is <i>not</i>
the language of Moses. Moses says,&mdash;"Who shall go
<i>over the sea</i> for us?" (&#964;&#8055;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#957;
&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962;;) And since the version of the LXX
is what the Author of the Epistle to the Romans
follows in this place, it is reasonable to expect that
he would adhere to that version, or at least to the
sense of that version, in the exhibition of so important
a clause as the present. Whereas, instead of
"Who shall go <i>over the sea</i>," we find St. Paul writing,&mdash;"Who
shall <i>go down into the deep?</i>" (&#932;&#8055;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7940;&#946;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#957;;)&mdash;language evidently highly
suggestive of the mysterious transaction to which the
same St. Paul says it contains a reference<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>; but certainly
<i>not</i> the language of Moses. And we shall be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>reminded that this is not merely phraseology rescued
from vagueness, and made definite; but it is the
actual substitution of one thought for another. This
is what will be said; and if it be followed up by the
assertion that here, therefore, we have a clear example
of Scriptural Accommodation, it might seem, at
first sight, impossible to deny the fact.</p>

<p>For our own parts, we are inclined to meet the
present difficulty, and every similar one, in quite
another spirit; and dispose of the objection, somewhat
in the following way. The same <span class="smcap">God</span> who gave us
the Scriptures of the Old Testament, gave us the
New Testament also. The Bible is <i>one</i>. He who inspired
the Law, inspired the Gospel. The <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span> pleads with us in both alike.&mdash;Surely, therefore,
He who spake of old time by the Prophets, may
be allowed, when, in the last days, He speaks by the
Apostles of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;to explain His earlier meaning,
if He will. Surely, He may tell the Israel of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;if
He pleases,&mdash;what He meant by the language He
held of old time to Israel after the flesh! Yea, and
if it seemeth good to Him to call in the wealth of
His ancient treasury, in order to recoin it that He
may the more enrich us thereby:&mdash;if it pleases Him
to take His ancient speeches back again into His
mouth, in order that He may syllable them anew,&mdash;making
them sweeter than honey to our lips, yea,
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb;&mdash;what is
<i>Man</i> that he should reply against <span class="smcap">God</span>? What should
be our posture, at witnessing such a spectacle, but
one of Adoration? What, our becoming language,
but praise?</p>

<p>It is easy to anticipate the answer that will be
made to all this. We shall be told that we are, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>some sort, begging the question. The Bible is an
Inspired Book, indeed: but <i>what is Inspiration</i>?&mdash;Moses
wrote the Book called "Deuteronomy:" St.
Paul wrote the Epistle to the Romans. And St. Paul,&mdash;quoting
a passage out of the older record,&mdash;has
substituted a sentiment of his own for a sentiment
contained in the writings of Moses. He does the
same thing in other places; and elsewhere, as here,
he proceeds to reason upon the data he has so obtained.
<i>This</i>, it will be said, is the phenomenon
which we have to deal with.</p>

<p>But, we reply, it is manifest that he who so argues,&mdash;with
all his apparent good sense, and fairness,&mdash;is
entirely committed to a theory concerning Inspiration;
and <i>that</i> a very unworthy one. The Bible comes to us
as an Inspired Book; claiming to be the very Word
of <span class="smcap">God</span>. The Holy Church throughout all the World,
doth acknowledge it to be so. Surely, therefore, it is
for <i>us</i> to study its contents by the light of this previous
fact.&mdash;But quite contrary is the method of our
opponents. They treat the Bible as if it were an
ordinary Book. They submit its contents to the same
irreverent handling as they would the productions
of a merely human intellect. They not only reason
<i>about</i> its claims from its contents,&mdash;but they would
even pronounce <i>upon</i> its claims, from the same evidence.
They dare to sit in judgment upon it. Hence
their lax notions on the subject of Inspiration. They
first run riot among statements which are too hard
for them; and when they have perplexed themselves
with these, till the field is strewed with doubts, and
the limits of unbelief and mistrust have become extended
on every side,&mdash;Inspiration, like an ill-defined
boundary-line on a map, is suffered faintly to hem in,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>and enclose the utmost verge of the unhappy domain.&mdash;Whereas,
we maintain that a belief in the Bible,
as an Inspired Book, should, at the outset, prescribe
a limit to human speculations.</p>

<p>Let this belief encircle us exactly, and entirely;
and define, at once, the area within which all our
reasonings must be taught to marshal themselves, and
to find their full development. In brief, our opponents
meet our remonstrance by another; but, as we contend,
an unreasonable one;&mdash;at least, as proceeding
from men who, no less than ourselves, allow freely
the Inspiration of Scripture. <i>We</i> say,&mdash;The Bible is
the word of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Fill your heart with this conviction,
and then humbly address yourself to the study of
its pages.&mdash;It is argued on the other side,&mdash;The pages
of the Bible are full of perplexing statements. They
evolve strange phenomena, interminably. Convince
yourself of this; and then make up your mind, if you
can, about the Inspiration of the Bible<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>.... I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>have occasion, by and by, to explain more in detail the
spirit in which the Divine Logic,&mdash;<i>Inspired reasoning</i>
as it may be called,&mdash;is to be approached. For the
moment, I am content to waive the question; and to
be St. Paul's apologist, almost as if I had met with
his words in an uninspired book.</p>

<p>Solemnly protesting, then, that the ground we
have just occupied is the only <i>true</i> ground on which
to take our stand; but withdrawing from it because
we do not fear the appeal to unassisted Reason, even
in matters of Faith,&mdash;so that the proper limits and
conditions of inquiry be but observed;&mdash;we proceed
to inquire whether,&mdash;apart from Revelation,&mdash;there be
not good ground for believing that the words of the
ancient Hebrew Lawgiver and Prophet contain and
mean the very thing which the Christian Apostle <i>says</i>
they do.&mdash;We change our language at this stage of
the inquiry. We no longer assert, (as before we did,)
that the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> speaking by the mouth of Moses,
<i>must have meant</i>, what the same <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, speaking
by the mouth of St. Paul, declares that He <i>did</i>
mean. We are willing to study the sacred text solely
by the light which grave criticism and patient learning
have thrown upon it.&mdash;Our inquiry now, is this;&mdash;Although
the words in Deuteronomy, read over
attentively by ourselves, suggest no such Christian
meaning as we find affixed to them in the Epistle to
the Romans,&mdash;is there no reason, traditional or otherwise,
for supposing that they <i>do</i> envelope that meaning;
yea, so teem and swell with it, that the germ of
the flower may be actually detected in the yet unopened
bud?... I proceed to this inquiry.</p>

<p>1. And first, it is obvious, to any one reading the
xxixth and xxxth chapters of the last Book of Moses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>that they contain <i>another Covenant</i>, beside that of
Horeb. This is expressly stated in the first verse of
the xxixth chapter:&mdash;"These are the words of the
Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make
with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, <i>beside
the Covenant which He made with them in Horeb</i><a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>." Not
to stand too stiffly thereupon, however<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>, let it be at
least freely allowed that even if we choose to regard
this chapter and the next as a <i>renewal</i> only of the
Covenant made in Horeb, it is a <i>distinct</i> renewal;&mdash;both
in respect of time and of place. Of time,&mdash;for
whereas the Covenant of Sinai belongs to the <i>first</i> of
the forty years of wandering, the Covenant of Moab
belongs to the <i>last</i>. Of place,&mdash;for whereas the other
was made at the furthest limit of the people's wanderings,
<i>this</i> belongs to their nearest approach to Canaan.&mdash;And
I confidently ask, After <i>such</i> an announcement,
and at a moment like <i>that</i>,&mdash;the forty years of typical
wandering ended, and the earthly type of the heavenly
inheritance full in view, Jordan alone intercepting the
vision of their Rest;&mdash;shall we wonder, if here and
there a ray of coming glory shall be found to flash
through the language of the dying patriarch? if some
traces shall be discernible, even in the language of
Moses, of the dayspring of the Gospel of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?</p>

<p>2. We find that it contains not a few sayings in
support of such a presumption. The 10th verse opens
the covenant, and in the following solemn language:&mdash;"Ye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>stand, this day, all of you, before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
your <span class="smcap">God</span>: the Captains of your tribes, your Elders,
and your officers, with all the men of Israel;&mdash;your
little ones, your wives, and the stranger that is in thy
camp,&mdash;from the hewer of thy wood, to the drawer
of thy water." And what was the <i>intention</i> of this
solemn standing before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? Even&mdash;"that
thou shouldest enter into Covenant with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and enter into His oath, which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
<span class="smcap">God</span> maketh with thee this day."&mdash;The purport of the
Covenant thus to be made, was, that <span class="smcap">God</span> might establish
Israel that day for a people unto Himself, and
that He might be unto them a <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;(an expression
elsewhere appropriated by the Great Apostle to the
Christian Church<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>,)&mdash;as He had ... sworn unto their
fathers, <i>to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob</i>. So that
we have here the renewal of the <i>Evangelical Covenant</i>
made with Abraham, and renewed to Isaac and Jacob,&mdash;which
is clearly distinguished in Scripture from the
<i>Legal</i> Covenant, made with their children 430 years
after; and which is declared ineffectual to disannul the
earlier one, confirmed before by <span class="smcap">God</span>, and pointing
entirely to <span class="smcap">Christ</span><a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. That earlier Evangelical Covenant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>then, it was, which was renewed in the land of
Moab;&mdash;in the course of renewing which, the words
of the text occur.</p>

<p>3. And that it was indeed the Evangelical, (not the
Legal Covenant,) which is here spoken of, is abundantly
confirmed by the subsequent language of the
passage: for Moses proceeds,&mdash;"Neither with you
only do I make this Covenant and this oath; but with
him that standeth here this day with us before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> our <span class="smcap">God</span>, and <i>also with him that is not here with
us this day</i><a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>:" meaning, (as the ancient Targum expounds
the place,) "<i>with every generation that shall
rise up unto the world's end</i>." It was the same Covenant,
therefore, which is made with <i>ourselves</i>; "for the
promise is unto" us, and to our "children, and to all
that are afar off, even as many as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our <span class="smcap">God</span>
shall call<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>:" "<i>not</i> according to the Covenant which
<span class="smcap">God</span> made with the Fathers of Israel in the day that
He took them by the hand to bring them out of the
Land of Egypt<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>."</p>

<p>Yet more remarkably perhaps is this established by
the language of the ensuing chapter: for <span class="smcap">God</span> therein
promises that <i>Circumcision of the heart</i> whereby men
should be enabled to love the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their <span class="smcap">God</span> with
<i>all their heart</i> and with <i>all their soul</i>. Now this seems
clearly to intimate not legal but Evangelical obedience,&mdash;the
result of the free outpouring of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>; of which, in the Law, (properly so
called,) we find no promise whatever. Here then we
discover another anticipation of something which belongs
to the times of the Gospel.</p>

<p>And this Evangelical complexion is to be recognized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>in the entire contents of the xxixth and xxxth chapters.
They contain no single mention of ceremonial
rites or observances,&mdash;of which the Law is, for the
most part, full. But free obedience and perfect love
are inculcated as the condition of blessedness: while
hearty repentance is made the sole condition of forgiveness
of sin.</p>

<p>In connexion with this, I may call your attention
to a curious coincidence,&mdash;if indeed it be not something
more. On the sincere repentance of the people,
it is promised "that then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy <span class="smcap">God</span> will turn
thy captivity;" which the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases,&mdash;"His
<span class="smcap">Word</span> will receive with delight thy
repentance:" while the Septuagint even more remarkably
renders the words&mdash;"will heal thy sins;" that
is,&mdash;"will be thy <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>." Moses proceeds,&mdash;"and
gather thee from all the nations whither the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy <span class="smcap">God</span> hath called thee." And what is this but one
of the very places, if it be not <i>the very place</i>, to which
St. John alludes when he declares that Caiaphas prophesied
that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> should die for that nation; and not
for that nation only; but that He should gather together
in one, the children of <span class="smcap">God</span> that were scattered
abroad<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>?</p>

<p>4. Nor is it, finally, a little remarkable that, by
the general consent of the Hebrew Doctors, this xxxth
chapter has ever been held to have reference to the
times of <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>. The restoration spoken, is referred
by them to the restoration to be effected by <span class="smcap">Christ</span>:
while the promises it contains are connected with
those prophetic intimations which clearly point to the
days of the Gospel<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>So much, then, for the evidence, <i>apart from Revelation</i>,
which the general complexion of the place in
Deuteronomy affords to the reasonableness of the
meaning affixed to it by the voice of the later Scriptures.
Before we proceed to examine a little in detail
the words of the text, we may be surely allowed
to remind ourselves of the Testimony which St. Paul
bears to the Evangelical character of what is here
delivered. He asserts, in the most direct and emphatic
manner, that it is the Righteousness which is
by Faith which here speaks<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>. He is contrasting the
spirit of the Law, with that of the Gospel. He is
setting the requirements of the one against those of
the other. To exhibit the former,&mdash;he quotes from
Leviticus. To enable us to judge of the latter,&mdash;he
quotes this very place in Deuteronomy. Having
shewn the justification under the Law,&mdash;which is by
entire fulfilment of every enjoined work;&mdash;the Apostle
describes the Righteousness of the Gospel,&mdash;which
is by Faith in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. And he discovers its
voice in the present chapter: nay, he calls our attention
to its language; and, lest the intention of it
should escape us, he proceeds to supply us, not only
with an interpretation of it, but with a paraphrase
as well.</p>

<p>Enough has been said, I trust, to render this proceeding
on the part of the Apostle no matter of surprise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>Let us see whether the particulars of his interpretation
are altogether novel and unprecedented
either.&mdash;The words of Moses which we have to consider,
it will be remembered, are these:&mdash;The "commandment
which I command thee this day, it is not
hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in
Heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for
us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear
it and do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that
thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the Sea for us,
and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,
and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>."</p>

<p>Now, that all this denotes something close at hand
and easy,&mdash;in place of something supposed to be remote
and difficult,&mdash;is obvious. The whole of the
earlier part of it, St. Paul affirms to be tantamount to
the following injunction,&mdash;"Say not in thine heart,
Who shall ascend into Heaven, to bring <span class="smcap">Christ</span> down;
or who descend into the abyss, to bring <span class="smcap">Christ</span> up
from the dead." Concerning which words of caution,
we have to remark that there seems to have been
no intention whatever on the part of the Apostle, to
warn <i>his readers</i> against requiring a renewed Revelation
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in the flesh, or a second Resurrection
of the Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span> from the dead. He is illustrating
the nature of Legal and Evangelical Righteousness,
by the language of the Jewish Law. He contrasts
the two, in their respective requirements; finding
the voice of both in the writings of Moses: of the
former,&mdash;in connexion with the covenant of Sinai; of
the latter,&mdash;in connexion with the covenant which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded Moses to make with the children
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>of Israel in the land of Moab, <i>besides</i> the former
Covenant. With characteristic fire and earnestness,
glancing, as usual, at every side of the question before
him,&mdash;having, a little way back, explained himself,
without explanation, when he inserted that remarkable
parenthetical clause, &#964;&#8051;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#965; <span class="smcap">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span><a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>,&mdash;"for
<i><span class="smcap">Christ</span></i> is the object of the Law;"&mdash;in order
now to shew how thoroughly this is the case,&mdash;how full
the Law is of <i>Him</i>, in whom alone it finds its perfect
scope, end, and completion,&mdash;he explains that the
very phrase "Who shall ascend up into Heaven?"
pointed to nothing less than <i>the Incarnation</i> of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>:
that, "Who shall go over the Sea?" contained a
wondrous far-sighted allusion,&mdash;(not the less real because
unsuspected,)&mdash;even to the <i>Resurrection</i> of our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> from death. So true is it, "that both in the Old
and New Testament Everlasting Life is offered to
Mankind by <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, who is the only Mediator between
<span class="smcap">God</span> and Man, being both <span class="smcap">God</span> and Man. Wherefore
they are not to be heard, which feign that the old
Fathers did look only for transitory promises<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>."</p>

<p>Moses then here warns the ancient people of <span class="smcap">God</span>
against an evil heart of unbelief. "Say not in thy
heart, Who shall ascend up into Heaven?" for such
words on the part of Man would imply disbelief in the
doctrine that the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> should hereafter take
upon Him human flesh. (Since "no man hath ascended
up to Heaven, but He that came down from
Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>.")
"Neither say, Who shall descend into the deep?"
for such words on human lips must imply disbelief in
<span class="smcap">Messiah's</span> Descent into Hell, and Resurrection from
the Dead.&mdash;The mystery of Redemption might not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>be impatiently demanded; but must be looked for in
faith, until the fulness of time should come, and the
whole mystery of godliness should be revealed to
the wondering eyes of Men and Angels<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>.</p>

<p>We shall perhaps be asked, whether it is credible
that Moses can have had any conception that such
a meaning as St. Paul here ascribes to his words, did
really underlie them? To which we answer, first, that
it is by no means incredible<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>. And next, that whether
Moses knew the full meaning of the language he
was commissioned to deliver, or not,&mdash;seems, (as already
explained<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>,) to be an entirely separate question:
the only question before us, being, <i>whether his language
contained that meaning</i>, or not.... To what extent
the Prophets,&mdash;who, (we know,) studied their own
prophecies<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>,&mdash;were ever permitted to fathom their
depth, is a mere matter of speculation<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>; delightful indeed,
but in the present case quite irrelevant. In the
meantime, we know for certain that <i>Moses prophesied
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i><a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>.</p>

<p>And next, if it be said that really this is only a
proverbial expression,&mdash;a Hebrew phrase to denote
something passing difficult, and hard of attainment:&mdash;(as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>when, in the Book of Proverbs, it is asked,&mdash;"Who
hath ascended up into Heaven, or who hath
descended<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>?")&mdash;we answer, we see no ground whatever
for supposing that in the place just quoted, it <i>is</i>
a proverb, and no more,&mdash;although from its use in
the Talmud, the expression would certainly appear to
have become, at last, proverbial<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>. <i>If</i> a proverb, however,
it seems to have been a sacred one; nor can
any place be appealed to where it occurs, nearly of
the antiquity of <i>this</i>, in the writings of Moses. To
pretend therefore to explain away a certain mode of
expression, in the place where it <i>first</i> stands on record,&mdash;and
where it is declared to have a deep and mysterious
meaning,&mdash;simply because, <i>subsequently</i>, it was
(to all appearance) used <i>without</i> any such pregnancy
of signification,&mdash;is, manifestly illogical.</p>

<p>Nay, there is good ground for presuming, that the
very place last quoted, contains a reference to the
Eternal <span class="smcap">Son</span>: for Agur proceeds to ask,&mdash;"What is
His Name, and <i>what is His Son's Name</i>, if thou canst
tell<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>?" ... But the reference is far more obvious when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>the same expressions occur in the Book of Baruch.
"Who hath gone up into Heaven, and taken her, and
brought her down from the clouds? Who hath gone
over the sea, and found her<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>?" For <i>Wisdom</i> is there
spoken of; and Wisdom, as we remember, is one of
the names of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&mdash;the name by which He is discoursed
of, in the Book of Proverbs.</p>

<p>The uninspired evidence which completes the connexion
of this place of Deuteronomy with the second
Person in the Blessed Trinity, is the traditional interpretation
assigned to it by the Hebrew Commentators.
The Targum of Jerusalem expounds the latter clause
as follows:&mdash;"Neither is the Law beyond the Great
Sea, that thou shouldest say, O that we had one <i>like
Jonas the prophet</i> that might go down to the bottom
of the Great Sea, and bring it to us." So that the
very Jewish Doctors themselves here become our instructors;
and teach us that a greater than Jonas
must be here,&mdash;even while they guide our eyes to
that especial type of our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span> in His Descent
into Hell, and Rising again from the dead. I
say, the very Jewish Doctors themselves here contribute
their testimony; and yield a most unsuspicious
witness to the inspired exegesis of the Apostle: for,
"as Jonas was three days and three nights in the
whale's belly,"&mdash;so, (they clearly mean to say), so
should it be with the man whom Moses here indicateth:
and so,&mdash;(these are the words of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself),&mdash;so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>was "<i>the Son of Man</i> three days and three
nights in the heart of the Earth<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>."</p>

<p>You will of course notice the facility with which
the Jews themselves, interpreting their own Scriptures,
have here exchanged the notions of going
"<i>over</i> the sea,"&mdash;("<i>beyond</i> the sea," as it is in the
Hebrew,)&mdash;and "<i>going down to the bottom</i>" of the sea.
St. Paul seems, in this place, to have "accommodated"
the words of Moses: but we cannot fail to perceive
that the Hebrew text must cry aloud for such supposed
"accommodation;" yea, cry aloud, even in the
uncircumcised ears of the Jewish people; that their
own Commentators, as if divinely guided by the good
hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>, should bear their own independent witness
to the correctness of the Apostolic interpretation.</p>

<p>Nor may I fail to call your attention to the term
employed by St. Paul to denote the Sea:&mdash;a term,
surely divinely chosen. He had just before, (in the
6th and 7th verses,) employed the Version of the
LXX: he was about to use it again in the 8th verse:
but in this, (the 7th,) he departs from it. Instead of,&mdash;
&#932;&#8055;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; <span style="letter-spacing: 0.25em;">&#952;&#945;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962;</span>;
he writes,&mdash;&#932;&#8055;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; <span style="letter-spacing: 0.25em;">&#7940;&#946;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span>. The
term &#7940;&#946;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#962;,&mdash;which is applicable to the deep places
of the Earth, <i>and</i> to the depth of the Sea, with equal
propriety;&mdash;(being a more indifferent term even than
our own expression "the deep");&mdash;affords a memorable
example of the fulness and pregnancy of language
on inspired lips. Adhering to the letter of
the text he quotes, the Apostle, by changing <i>the word</i>
expressive of that literal sense, embraces the whole
spiritual breadth and fulness of the passage:&mdash;reminding
us of Him, by the blood of whose covenant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>were sent forth the prisoners of hope out of the pit
<i>wherein is no water</i><a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>,&mdash;even before he names Him;
our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span>!</p>

<p>I must also remind you, that there are many expressions
used by our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, or used concerning Him
by His Apostles, which help to shew, that, to have
come down from Heaven,&mdash;and to have been brought
up from the deep of the Earth again,&mdash;may be regarded
as the mysterious summary of the <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span>
Mission<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>.&mdash;"No man hath <i>ascended up</i> to Heaven,"
(saith our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,) "but He that <i>came down</i> from Heaven<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>."
"I am the living Bread which <i>came down</i>
from Heaven.... Doth this offend you? What and
if ye shall see the Son of Man <i>ascend up</i> where He
was before<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>?" In another place,&mdash;"I came forth
from the <span class="smcap">Father</span> and am come into the World: again
I leave the World, and go to the <span class="smcap">Father</span><a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>."&mdash;But the
most remarkable place remains: "Now, that He <i>ascended</i>,
what is it but that He also <i>descended first</i> into
the lowest parts of the Earth? He that <i>descended</i>, is
the same also that <i>ascended up</i> far above all Heavens<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>."
I say, this brief summary,&mdash;given by <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself,
or by those who had seen Him,&mdash;of the mystery of
His manifestation in the flesh,&mdash;throws light on the
language of the Hebrew lawgiver. It shews that
the language of Moses to Israel, in the plains of
Moab, fairly embraced the two great truths which
Faith even now can but be exhorted to lay fast hold
upon, and to appropriate:&mdash;"If thou shalt confess
with thy mouth that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,"&mdash;that is,
confess that the man Jesus is the uncreated, Incarnate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>; "and believe with thy heart that <span class="smcap">God</span>
raised Him up from the dead,&mdash;thou shalt be saved." ...
Such is the form which the exhortation <i>now</i> assumes.
More darkly, of old time,&mdash;(as was fitting,)&mdash;was
the same thing spoken: and, because reference
was then made to an event not yet accomplished, the
impatience of Unbelief is there repressed,&mdash;rather
than the ardour of Faith stimulated. "Say not in
thy heart who shall ascend into Heaven? or, who
shall go down into the deep place?" ... But shall
we deal so faithlessly with the Divine Oracles of the
Old Testament, as to deny them the deeper meaning
assigned to them in the New, because they speak
darkly? Let us, from a review of all that has been
humbly offered,&mdash;let us at least admit that there is
good independent ground for believing that when
Moses spake of ascending into Heaven,&mdash;it was with
reference to the future coming of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>:&mdash;when he
made mention of descending into the Deep,&mdash;the
Resurrection of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> of the World was, in
reality, the thing he spake of.&mdash;Let us allow that
<i>here</i>, at least, there is nothing in the language of the
New Testament, which, when studied by the light
of unassisted Reason, does not appear to have been
fully included, contemplated, intended by the language
of the Old:&mdash;that the accommodation has not
been arbitrary;&mdash;say rather, that <i>here</i> at least there
has been <i>no accommodation at all</i>!</p>

<p>But I am impatient to leave this low rationalistic
ground, and take my stand again, on the vantage
ground of Faith. The position, I trust, has been
established, that even in the case of words which
seem least promising,&mdash;least likely to enfold the
deeply mysterious meaning claimed for them by an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Apostle,&mdash;the result of patient inquiry and research is
to shew that such a meaning really <i>does</i> exist there,
to the fullest extent. We have discovered, from mere
grounds of Reason, apart from Revelation, that what
St. Paul has cited in this place from Deuteronomy,
may very well contain all that he says it contains.
But, were nothing of the kind discoverable;&mdash;were it
a most hopeless endeavour to reconcile the meaning
evolved by the inspired Apostle, with the text he
professes to interpret,&mdash;the claims of the sacred exegesis
would remain wholly unimpaired. We should
still say that <i>this</i>, because it is an <i>inspired</i> Commentary,
is entitled to our fullest acceptance. We
have, anyhow, the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> interpreting Himself.
He surely must be the best judge of His own Divine
meaning. He does but enrich the Treasury of Truth,
even by His apparent departures from the original
Hebrew verity. Shall not the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, the Comforter,
be allowed to speak comfort to His people in
whatever way seemeth best to Himself? Is it not
lawful for Him to do what He will with His own?
Is thine eye evil, because He is very good?</p>

<p>Yes, it cannot be too emphatically insisted on, that
the success which may attend investigations of this
nature, is not to be admitted for a moment as the
measure of the soundness of the principle on which
they proceed. The reasoning whereby Newton shewed
that the diamond is a combustible substance would
have been no whit invalidated had the diamond resisted
to this hour every chemical attempt to reduce
it to carbon. We do not,&mdash;(what need to say?)&mdash;we
do not discourage the endeavour to enucleate the deep
Christian significancy of passages for which Inspired
writers claim such sublime meaning. Rather do we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>think that Human Reason could not find a worthier
field for the employment of her powers<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>, than this.
But we are strenuous to insist that the full and sufficient,
and only irrefragable proof that a mighty
Christian meaning does actually underlie the unpromising
utterance of one of <span class="smcap">God's</span> ancient Saints,
is,&mdash;<i>that an Inspired Writer declares it to exist there</i>.</p>

<p>There is no <i>accommodation</i> therefore, when an inspired
writer adduces Scripture. Human language
<i>will</i> sometimes require to be "accommodated:" Divine
language, never! May not the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> lay
His finger on whatever parts of His ancient utterance
He sees fit? may He not invert clauses, and (in order
to bring out His meaning better) even alter words?
If He tells thee that the prophetic allusion of Isaiah to
"our griefs" and "our sorrows" comprehends "our
infirmities" and "our sicknesses" in its span<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>,&mdash;is
it for <i>thee</i> to discredit His assertion? If He is pleased
to intimate that the providential arrangement whereby
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, though born at Bethlehem, grew up at Nazareth,&mdash;had
for its object the fulfilment of many a detached
and seemingly disconnected prophecy<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>,&mdash;shall
the unexpectedness of His disclosure excite ridicule in
such an one as thyself? When He tells thee that besides
the immediate scope of certain well-known words
of Hosea and of Jeremiah, there was the ulterior aim
He indicates; if behind Israel after the flesh, He
shews thee the Anointed <span class="smcap">Son</span><a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>,&mdash;if behind those captive
Jews of the tribe of Benjamin whom Nebuzar-Adan
led past their mother's grave on their way to
Babylon, He points to the slaughtered infant of Bethlehem;
assuring thee that when He spake by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>mouth of Jeremiah concerning the nearer event that
remoter one was full before Him also; and that the
solemn and affecting utterance of the Prophet was
divinely intended by Himself to cover both<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>;&mdash;wilt
thou, when He discourses to thee thus, presume to
talk to Him of "<i>accommodation?</i>" Is it not enough
for thee to have cavilled at the first page of the <i>Old</i>
Testament on "scientific" grounds? Must thou, for
Theological considerations, dispute the first page of
the <i>New</i> Testament also?</p>

<p>Scripture then, whether in its Historical or its more
obviously prophetic parts, has this depth of meaning for
which I have been contending. We must perforce believe
it, for it is a matter of express Revelation. We
cannot pretend to deny the probability,&mdash;much less
the possibility of it; for we really <i>can</i> know nothing
of the matter except from an attentive study of Scripture
itself. And the witness of Scripture, as we have
seen, is ample, emphatic, and express.&mdash;Our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
being indignantly asked by the Jews if He heard
what the children, crying in the Temple, said of Him,&mdash;made
answer by quoting the 2nd verse of the viiith
Psalm: "Yea, have ye never read, 'Out of the mouth
of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise'<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>?"&mdash;Pray
was this "accommodation," or what was it?
It was deemed a sufficient answer, at all events, by
the Anointed <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>; whatever men may think!...
When the Sadducees, disbelieving in the Resurrection
of the Body, assailed our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with a speculative
difficulty, He told them that they erred because they
did not understand the Scriptures. "Now that the
dead <i>are</i> raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
when he calleth the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Abraham, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Isaac, and the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Jacob. For He is
not a <span class="smcap">God</span> of the dead, but of the living: for all live
unto Him<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>." How, by the popular method,&mdash;how,
by any of the new lights which have lately been let
in on Holy Scripture,&mdash;was the Resurrection of the
dead to have been proved by the words which the
<span class="smcap">Second Person</span> in the Trinity spake to Moses "in
the Bush?" And yet we behold <i>that</i> same Divine
Personage in the days of His humiliation, proposing
from those words, uttered by Himself 1500 years before,
to <i>establish</i> the doctrine in dispute!... Only
once more. "In the last day, that great day of the
Feast [of Tabernacles,] <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> stood and cried, saying,
If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.
He that believeth on Me,&mdash;<i>as the Scripture hath said,
'Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</i><a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>!'"&mdash;But
<i>where</i> does the Scripture say <i>that</i>? You will
look a long while to find it. You will never find it
at all if you adhere to the method which of late has
been declared to be the method most in fashion.
You will never even understand what our Blessed
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>means</i>, unless you attend to the hint which immediately
follows,&mdash;and which the Divine Author of
the Gospel would not surfer us to be without,&mdash;namely,
that, "This spake He of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, which they that
believe on Him should receive:"&mdash;by which is meant,
that as many of the Prophets as discoursed in dark
phrase of that free outpouring of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> which
was to mark <span class="smcap">Messiah's</span> Reign, did, <i>in effect</i>, say the
thing which He here attributes to them.</p>

<p>Inspired Reasoning, wherever found, may fitly obtain
a few words of distinct notice here; but I shall
perhaps speak more becomingly, as well as prove more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>intelligible, if,&mdash;(without further allusion to the sayings
of that Almighty One "in whom are hid all the
treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>;" sayings which
it seems a species of impiety to approach except in
adoration;)&mdash;I confine my remarks to the logical processes
observable in the inspired writings of some of
His servants, the Evangelists and Apostles of <span class="smcap">the
Lamb</span>.</p>

<p>The difficulty which has been occasionally felt in
respect of the argumentative parts of St. Paul's Epistles,
is considerable, and may not be overlooked. His
definitions, his inferences, his entire method of handling
Scripture, gives offence to a certain class of minds.
His reasoning seems inconsequential. There appears
to be a want of logical order and consistency in much
that he delivers. But,&mdash;can it require to be stated?&mdash;the
fault is entirely our own. "The radical fallacy
of any attempt to analyze the reasoning of Scripture
by the ordinary Laws of Logic" requires to be pointed
out. And the root of it all is our assumption that an
inspired Apostle must perforce argue like any other
uninspired man.</p>

<p>But, in the first place, it is to be recollected that he
did not collect the meaning and bearing of the Old
Testament Scriptures from induction, and study <i>only</i>.
He was,&mdash;by the hypothesis,&mdash;an <i>inspired Writer</i>. The
same <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> who taught the authors of the Old
Testament what to deliver, taught <i>him</i>, in turn, how
to explain their words. By direct Revelation, he perceived
the intention of a text, and at once bore witness
to it. Thus St. Paul says of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;"He is
not ashamed to call them brethren, saying,&mdash;'I will
declare Thy Name unto My brethren, in the midst of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>the Church will I sing praise unto Thee.' And again,&mdash;'I
will put my trust in Him.' And again,&mdash;'Behold
I and the children which <span class="smcap">God</span> hath given Me<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>.'"
Now, "the Apostles quoted such places as these from
the Psalms and Isaiah, not as they were gathered by
any certain reason, but as revealed to them by the
<span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>, to be principally spoken of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. This
understanding the mysteries of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the Old Testament,
being a special gift of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span><a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>,&mdash;of
the truth of which interpretations, the same <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>,
without any necessary demonstration thereof, bore
witness also to their auditors and converts; and by
miracles manifested the persons thus expounding them
herein to be infallible<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>."</p>

<p>To quote the language of a thoughtful writer of
more recent date,&mdash;"Inspired teaching,&mdash;explain it
how we may,&mdash;seems comparatively indifferent to
(what seems to us so peculiarly important) close logical
connexion, and the intellectual symmetry of doctrines....
The necessity of confuting gainsayers, at
times forced one of the greatest of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> inspired
servants, St. Paul, to prosecute continuous argument;
yet even with him, how abrupt are the transitions,
how intricate the connexion, how much is conveyed
<i>by assumptions such as Inspiration alone can make</i>, without
any violation of the canons of reasoning,&mdash;<span class="smcap">for
with it alone assertion is argument</span>.... The same
may be said of some passages of St. John, supposed to
have been similarly occasioned. Inspiration has ever
left to human Reason the filling up of its outlines, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>careful connexion of its more isolated truths. The
two are, as the lightning of Heaven, brilliant, penetrating,
far-flashing, abrupt,&mdash;compared with the
feebler but <i>continuous</i> illumination of some earthly
beacon<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>."</p>

<p>"In a train of inspired Seasoning," (as the same
writer elsewhere remarks,) "each new premiss may
have been supernaturally communicated; and thus, in
point of fact, the inspired reasoner but connects the
different threads of the Divine Counsels; exemplifies
how 'deep answereth to deep' in the mysteries of
Revelation; and presents, in one connected train of
argument, those words of <span class="smcap">God</span> which had been uttered
'at sundry times and in divers manners<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>'"</p>

<p>To conclude.&mdash;There is no such thing as inconsequential
Reasoning to be met with in the writings
of St. Paul<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>&mdash;no such thing as arbitrary Accommodation
of the Old Testament Scriptures, in the New:&mdash;though
not a few have thought it; and the language
of many more writers, Papist as well as Protestant,
is calculated to convey the same mischievous
impression<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>. The hypothesis is as unworthy of ourselves,&mdash;with
our boasted critical resources and many
appliances of varied learning,&mdash;as it is derogatory to
the Sacred Oracles to which it is applied. It is
a deadly blow, aimed at the very Inspiration of Scripture
itself; for it pretends to discover a human element
only, where we have a right to expect a Divine one:
an irresponsible <i>dictum</i>, when we listened for the voice
of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>; the hand of man, where we depended
on finding the very Finger of <span class="smcap">God</span>! We come to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>blessed pages, for Divinity, and we are put off with
Rhetoric. We come for bread, and the critics we
speak of offer us a stone.</p>

<p>I will not detain you any longer. No apology can
be needed for the subject which has been engaging our
attention<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>. Those who watch "the signs of the times"
attentively, will bear me witness that <i>unbelief</i> is one
fearful note of the coming age. The self-same principle,
working in different classes of minds, produces
results diametrically different: but it is still the
same principle which is at work. Unbelief is no less
the cause why so many have forsaken the Church of
their Fathers, to run after the blasphemous fables and
dangerous deceits of the Church of Rome,&mdash;than it is
the parent of that shallow Rationalism which unhappily
is now so popular among us.... Intimations of
what is to be hereafter, may be every now and then
detected. At intervals, hoarse sounds, from a distance,
are known to smite upon the listening ear; signals of
the coming danger,&mdash;sure harbingers of the approaching
storm.&mdash;Holy Scripture is the stronghold against
which the Enemy will make his assault, assuredly:
nor can we employ ourselves better than by building
one another up in reverence for its Inspired Oracles:
opposing to the crafts of the Evil One the simplicity
of a child-like faith; and resolutely refusing to see
less than <span class="smcap">God</span>, in <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word!</p>

<p>This must be the preacher's apology for disputing
where he would rather adore; for discussing the Revelations
of Scripture, instead of <i>feeding</i> upon them;
especially at this holy Season when the Apostle's exhortation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>finds an echo in all our services:&mdash;the
mouth, engaged in the constant confession that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
is the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;the heart, filled with the thought of
Him, who as at this time died for our sins, and rose
again for our Justification.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> grant us grace,&mdash;at this and every other time,&mdash;so
to put away the leaven of malice and wickedness,
that we may always serve Him in pureness of living
and truth: through the merits of the same His <span class="smcap">Son</span>,
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>!</p>

elaborate apology which has recently appeared for <i>Essays and
Reviews</i>:&mdash;"Among the many proposals which are floating about
for Essays and Counter-essays to vindicate the Doctrines supposed
to be combated in this volume, let us be allowed to suggest this
one:&mdash;'The Nature of Biblical Inspiration, as tested by a careful
examination of the Septuagint Version with special reference to
the sanction given to it by the Apostles, and to its variations, by
way of addition or omission, from the revised Text of the Canonical
Scriptures.' The conclusions of such an investigation would be
worth a hundred eager declarations on one side or the other, and
would be absolutely decisive of the chief questions at issue."
(<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, April, 1861, p.&nbsp;483.).... Now I scruple not
to affirm that a well-informed, and faithful student of the Scriptures
would covet no better portion for himself than liberty to
accept, in the most public manner possible, such a challenge as the
foregoing.</p></div>

<p style="margin-bottom:2em;"><i>Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures,
neither the power of God.</i></p></div>


<p>On a certain occasion, the Son of Man was asked
what was thought a hard question by those who,
in His day, professed "the negative Theology<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>."
There was a moral and there was physical marvel
to be solved. Both difficulties were met by a single
sentence. The Sadducean judgment had gone astray
from the Truth, (&#960;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#8118;&#963;&#952;&#949; our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> said,) from a
twofold cause: (1)&nbsp;The men did not understand those
very Scriptures to which they appealed so confidently:
and, (2)&nbsp;They had an unworthy notion of <span class="smcap">God's</span> power.&mdash;There
are plenty of Sadducees at the present day
among ourselves. They are as fond as ever of finding
difficulties in the self-same Scriptures. They are to be
met, I am persuaded, exactly as of old; by shewing
that their error is still the fruit of their ignorance of
Scripture; the consequence of their unworthy conceptions
of <span class="smcap">God</span>. I propose to illustrate this on the
present occasion. My subject, (one certainly not unsuited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>to the day,) is <i>the Marvels of Scripture</i>,&mdash;whether
Moral or Physical. I would fain have discussed
them apart; but I shall not have another opportunity.
I must handle the whole subject therefore within the
limits of a single Sermon: and by consequence I must
be extremely brief.</p>

<p>Now, I venture to assume that whatever, from its
extraordinary character, perplexes us in Scripture, is
a difficulty only <i>to ourselves</i>; that moral Marvels and
physical Miracles, alike, would cease to create any
difficulty if we knew more about <span class="smcap">God</span>. The Morality
of the Life to come, I do believe will prove none other
than the Morality of the life which now is; and so
I presume that it may be their Divine Author's will,
that the physical Laws of the Universe shall be eternal
likewise. And yet, as no thoughtful man will probably
be found to say that he thinks he knows as
much about the nature of these last now, as he expects
to know hereafter,&mdash;so it is to be presumed that
a sublimer, and therefore a juster view of the relation
in which the Creature stands to the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, will disclose
to us much which, at present, we should be little
prepared to admit, if it were speculatively presented
to us, ("as in a glass, darkly,") respecting the Moral
Government of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>I. In the very fore-front, however, of what I have
to say concerning those phenomena which are generally
cited as the <i>Moral Marvels</i> of Holy Scripture, I
must freely declare my opinion that nothing is wanted
but that the whole of the <i>historical</i> evidence should be
before us, in every case, in order that we might cease
to look upon them as marvels at all. But so it is,
that Scripture is severely brief: takes no pains to
conciliate our good opinion: seems to care nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>either for our applause or our censure. Scripture,
in short, has been made <i>an instrument of Man's probation</i><a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>.
It is for <i>us</i> to search curiously into the
record; to take an enlarged view of times and manners;
and finally, in the exercise of a generous Faith,
to decide whether the difficulty is such as ought to
occasion us any real distress. I proceed, in this spirit,
to consider, as briefly as possible, the history of Jael;
simply because I have heard stronger things said
against <i>her</i>, than against any of the Worthies of old
time who are mentioned with distinct approbation in
the Book of Life.</p>

<p>1. Now, if you choose to consider Jael as one who
lured a weary and unsuspecting soldier into her tent,&mdash;shewed
him hospitality,&mdash;and when he was asleep,
murdered him in cold blood,&mdash;you certainly cannot
help recoiling from the inspired decision that, "Blessed
above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
be." But I take the liberty of saying that this is
quite the wrong way to read her story. You must
begin it from the other end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> pronounces this woman blessed, and distinctly
commends her for her deed. From this point you
must start; remembering that <i>no action <span class="smcap">can</span> be immoral
which <span class="smcap">God</span> praises</i>. The Divine sentence, instead of
creating a difficulty, is, on the contrary, exactly the
thing which removes it<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. To weigh the story apart
from this, (which is the prime consideration of all,) is
like condemning the immorality of an executioner
without caring to hear that he is but carrying out the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>sentence of the Lawgiver. Furnished with the clue of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> approbation of Jael's deed, we retrace our steps,
and reconsider the narrative. If all were still dark
and hopeless, we might be sure that there are circumstances
withheld, which if known would have made
<span class="smcap">God's</span> justice clear as the light. But, as a matter
of fact, it generally happens that, when we "know
the Scriptures," the difficulty in great measure disappears;
and I am going to shew that it is so on the
present occasion.</p>

<p>I find that when the people of <span class="smcap">God</span> were on their
way out of Egypt into Canaan, they were indebted to
one family (the Kenites) for kindness and help<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>. The
head of that family was Jethro, the father-in-law of
Moses, high-priest of Midian,&mdash;in which land the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, from the burning bush, had commissioned the
future Lawgiver of Israel to redeem His people from
the bondage of Egypt. Jethro met them in the
Arabian desert; became their guide<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> till they reached
the promised Land; and with them entered the borders
of their future possession. It was a covenant between
the two races that they should share the goodness of
<span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>. Accordingly, the Kenites made their settlement
amid the Royal tribe of Judah; and it is easy
to foresee how close a bond would spring up between
the alien family and their avowed protectors, when,
to the memory of past dangers shared together, was
superadded the consciousness of present blessings;&mdash;especially
in an age when the law of hospitality was
held most sacred. How strong the bond became, the
sequel of the story convincingly shews<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>The children of Israel, at the end of a hundred and
fifty years, find themselves cruelly oppressed by the
most powerful of the Kings of the conquered but not
extirpated race. <span class="smcap">God</span> promises deliverance: and Deborah
is raised up to organize the resistance against
Jabin, "the captain of whose host was Sisera." Now,
while Heber the Kenite is gone with the rest to the
battle,&mdash;(for he had pitched his tent, remember, by
Kedesh; and it was from Kedesh<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> that Deborah "sent
and called Barak the son of Abinoam;")&mdash;while Heber,
the husband, I say, is gone to the battle, and Jael the
wife is left alone, distracted with anxiety, in the tent;&mdash;when,
weak and unprotected woman as she is, she
beholds the Captain of the hateful oppressor of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
people hastening to her tent, slumbering at her feet,
and unexpectedly within her power:&mdash;will you pretend
that <i>she</i>, a Midianitess, is to blame if she yields
to the strong impulse which prompts her to compass
the man's downfall, as speedily as she may? "There
was peace between Jabin the King of Hazor and the
house of Heber the Kenite<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>," you will remind me.
True: (between <i>Jabin</i>,&mdash;not between <i>Sisera</i>, by the
way:) without this, the whole incident would not have
happened. Sisera presumed on the peaceful relations
which existed between his lord and Heber; and
supposed that the sympathy of one alien race for another
was to outweigh every other consideration. Yet,
how stood the case? Heber had thrown in his lot,
irrevocably, with the people of <span class="smcap">God</span>; while Jabin
had already utterly violated the conditions of peace.
For twenty weary years, had Jael and her family
shared the hardships of that sacred line which Jabin
had "mightily oppressed." All her life long<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>highways have been unoccupied; and travellers have
had to walk through by-ways; and the villages have
been deserted by their inhabitants. Archers have infested
the very places of drawing water<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. Meanwile,
a sure word has gone forth from the Prophetess who
dwells under the palm-tree between Ramah and Bethel
on Mount Ephraim<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>, to the effect that <span class="smcap">God</span> will give
a mighty victory this day to His people<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>. Moreover,
Deborah, (to whom the children of Israel go up for
judgment,) has foretold that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will "<i>sell Sisera
into the hand of a woman</i><a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>". How <i>can</i> you marvel at
the rest!... With a faith strong and undoubting as
Rahab's, Jael,&mdash;weak woman as she is,&mdash;seizes the
wooden tent-pin and the mallet, (the only weapons
which are within her reach!); and, (somewhat as
David afterwards employed a stone and a sling for the
slaughter of the Philistine,) with these vile instruments,
at one blow, she smites to the earth the enemy
of God's people.... O, it was <i>not</i> because she was
treacherous, or because she was cruel! Treachery and
cruelty were not the vices to which a dweller in tents
(and she a woman!) was prone, when a thirsty soldier
begged a draught of water; and most assuredly, had
she been either, she would not,&mdash;she <i>could</i> not, have
won praise from God! (Witness <span class="smcap">God's</span> wrath against
David in the matter of Uriah, because <i>he</i> had no
pity<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>; as well as dying Jacob's denunciations against
Simeon and Levi because "instruments of cruelty"
were "in their habitations<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.") O no! It was because
she beheld in the slumbering captain at once the
enemy of her own afflicted race,&mdash;and of <span class="smcap">God's</span> oppressed
people,&mdash;and above all of <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself. <i>That</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>was why "she put her hand to the nail, and her right
hand to the workman's hammer!" ... The fight, you
are requested to remember, had been a tremendous
fight; and the battle, as she thought, was yet raging.
Reuben, and Dan, and Asher had kept aloof from the
encounter;&mdash;the first, in his rich pasture-land east
of the Jordan, abiding "among the sheepfolds, to hear
the bleatings of the flocks;" the two others, intent on
their maritime pursuits. Only some of Ephraim, Benjamin,
and Manasseh<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>, had been found willing to
throw in their lot with the two northern tribes of
Zebulun, and Naphtali,&mdash;who had "jeoparded their
lives unto the death." And the battle which these
had fought had been the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>; and as many as had
taken part with them, were considered to have come
"<i>to the help of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span></i>." Such then was the quarrel
which Jael had made her own; and such the spirit
in which she had done her wild deed of unassisted
prowess!</p>

<p>To appreciate her constancy and courage, you may
not overlook how fearful were the odds against the
cause she was espousing: on the oppressor's side, nine
hundred chariots of iron; whereas, "was there a shield
or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?" It
had been so terrific a day, that if the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had not been
on their side,&mdash;if the stars in their courses had not
fought for Israel,&mdash;how could Sisera have possibly been
overcome? But the very river was employed to sweep
the enemies of Israel away,&mdash;"that ancient river,
the river Kishon!" ... Now I boldly ask you, if the
Angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> may curse bitterly the inhabitants
of Meroz, "because they came not to the help of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span><span class="smcap">Lord</span>,"&mdash;(pray mark that phrase; for it shows exactly
in what light the conflict was regarded!)&mdash;"<i>to the
help of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span></i> against the mighty;" shall we wonder
if, by the Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>, Deborah the prophetess proclaims
"blessed above women in the tent" Jael the
wife of Heber the Kenite to be;&mdash;the undaunted one
by whose right hand the captain of all that mighty
host had been slain? Find me another "<i>woman in the
tent</i>" who may be compared with <i>her!</i> ... Or rather,
(for <i>that</i> is the only question,) shall these words embolden
us to impeach the morality of Holy Writ?... I
am sure there is not one of you all who really thinks
it. She was&mdash;was she not?&mdash;a courageous, a faithful,
and (according to her light,) a strictly virtuous woman.
She was content to risk <i>all</i>, "as seeing Him who is
invisible:" and to <i>believe</i> that "they that be with us
are more than they that be with them<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>." From the
unmistakeable evidence of her uncompromising boldness
in a good cause, her unwavering faith, her readiness
to cast in her lot with the people of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;no
one but a hypocrite will turn away to criticize the
details of her deed by the Gospel standard of Grace
and Truth. "He asked for water, and she gave him
milk." What would you have had her do? It is by
no means certain that she foresaw the deed which was
to follow, and which <i>cannot</i>, (from the nature of the
case,) have been the result of a preconcerted plan.
The impulse to terminate the tyranny of Canaan, and
the sufferings of her adopted people, as well as to
decide the fortune of that critical day, by slaying one
whom she regarded as the enemy of <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself, may
have seized her while she stood in the door of the tent,&mdash;weighing
Sisera's petition against Deborah's prophecy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Be this as it may,&mdash;would you have had the
woman connive at Sisera's escape,&mdash;the enemy of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> people, when <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself had unexpectedly
put him into her power?</p>

<p>It will assist us to understand this story, that we
should bear in mind how it fared with Ahab, King of
Israel, in the matter of Ben-hadad, King of Syria, as
recorded in the xxth chapter of the First Book of
Kings. "Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>," (was the Divine sentence,)
"<i>Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man
whom I appointed to utter destruction</i>, therefore thy life
shall go for his life, and thy people for his people<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>."
It is quite evident that as the <i>enemy of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>, in the
strictest sense, each fresh oppressor of Israel was regarded;
and that, as the enemy of the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span> of
Israel, Sisera was summarily slain by the Kenite's
wife.</p>

<p>Be so good as to remember also, that forgiveness of
enemies is strictly a <i>Christian</i> duty. You have no
right to expect to find the brightest jewels of the
kingdom of Heaven glittering on the swarthy brow of
an Arabian wife in the days of the Judges. "Grace
and <i>Truth</i> came by <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span><a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>." You cannot expect
to find the wife of Heber the Kenite more truthful
than Sarah, and Rebekah, and Rachel,&mdash;or even
than Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and David:
neither should you be so unreasonable as to expect
that the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Truth will award praise and blame
to His creatures by a higher standard of Morality than
He has seen fit, at any given period, to allow. A perfectly
enlightened conscience, no doubt, will never
consent to lie. A Christian woman in Jael's place,
ought not, of course, to be guilty of Jael's deed. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>you are forgetting the time of the world in which <i>your</i>
lot is thrown. I say nothing of the circumstances of
terror under which <i>she</i> acted,&mdash;<i>she</i> was <i>forced</i> to act.
How could she tell that Sisera would not awake ere
she should strike the blow,&mdash;or at least before she
could achieve his death? What if a company of
Jabin's host should come up to the tent-door, the instant
she had done the deed, and inquire after Sisera?
Suppose the issue of that day's encounter should prove
disastrous, what would be her own and Heber's fate?...
Feel a little for the poor wife,&mdash;for the lonely,
helpless "woman in the tent,"&mdash;<i>not</i> entirely for the
fierce soldier against whom you have heard the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
decree of death!... O ye, who, living in the full
blaze of Gospel light, in cold blood can reject the doctrine
of the Atonement, and deny the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> who
bought you, and teach that the Bible is "like any
other book;" who can make light of its Inspiration,
and evacuate its Prophecy, and idealize its Miracles;
who with your lips can profess the Church's doctrines,
and with your pens can deny them;&mdash;go <i>ye</i> and prate
of Morality, and Honesty, and Truth! <i>We</i> shall heed
mighty little your opinion of Jael's conduct, and of the
Divine Commendation which it met with. I believe
that, instead of suspecting the morality of the Bible
in this instance, there is hardly an honest Christian
heart among us, but cries out, on the contrary,&mdash;"<i>So</i>
let <i>all</i> Thine enemies perish, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>! But let them
that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in
his might."</p>

<p>2. There is no time to consider, as I fain would, any
other story; that of Jacob for example. It is quite
amazing to hear the presumptuous speeches concerning
that great Saint, in which good men sometimes permit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>themselves: as if the sum total of Jacob's history were
<i>this</i>:&mdash;that he once obtained an ungenerous advantage
over his Brother, and then shamefully deceived his
blind and aged Father. Whereas those were the two
great blots in an otherwise holy life! actions which were
followed by severe, aye lifelong punishment.&mdash;But I
must not enter on Jacob's history,&mdash;even to shew you
that a careless reader overlooks certain circumstances
which go a very long way indeed to excuse the actions
just alluded to. I prefer reminding you that since, at
Bethel, <span class="smcap">God</span> blessed the exile's slumbers with a glorious
vision, and most comfortable promise, on his first
setting out for Haran; and again at Jabbok, as well
as at Mahanaim, blessed him with a vision of Angels,
and a renewal of the blessing, on his return; <i>from this
point</i>, as before, it will be our wisdom to reason; and
we shall reason backwards. Had Scripture been quite
silent in all other respects, such proofs of the Divine
approval ought to be enough to convince a believing
heart that the only thing wanting must be fuller details,&mdash;more
evidence,&mdash;in order to shew us that the
Patriarch <i>deserved</i> the <span class="smcap">Spirit's</span> praise. But in truth,
in Jacob's case, the details are abundant and the
evidence decisive.</p>

<p>3. Of all the other (so called) difficulties which occur
to my memory,&mdash;as the extinction of the Canaanites,
(who yet were <i>not</i> extinguished,)&mdash;the Sacrifice of
Isaac, (who yet was <i>not</i> sacrificed,)&mdash;the life of David;&mdash;I
have only to say that before you can pretend to
have an opinion upon the subject you must be sure that
you "know the Scriptures:" else, I make bold to say,
you will inevitably err in your cogitations concerning
them. Thus, men are heard to insinuate astonishment
that the King who so basely compassed Uriah's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>death should have been "a man after <span class="smcap">God's</span> own
heart:" whereas the Hebrew original, (as they would
know, <i>if they knew the Scriptures</i>,) conveys nothing of
the kind; while the murder of Uriah is found to have
drawn down upon David unmitigated wrath and terrible
punishment from the right Hand of Him who
is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.</p>

<p>II. Turn we now, briefly, to the physical Marvels
which are described in the Bible; and chiefly those
which occur in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>I am about to speak of Miracles in general; but
it may be convenient to say a few words first about
certain mighty transactions which eclipse, by their
vastness or their strangeness, most isolated events.
Thus, as the Nativity, Temptation, Transfiguration,
Resurrection, Ascension, of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, together with
the Coming of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, eclipse in a manner
the other Miracles of the New Testament,&mdash;so the
Temptation of our first Parents, the Flood, the destruction
of Sodom and the fate of Lot's wife, the
burning bush, the Plagues which prepared the way
for the Exode, the crossing of the Red Sea, the
Manna, and the brazen Serpent; Balaam's ass, and
the fate of the walls of Jericho; the history of Jonah,
and of Daniel among the lions:&mdash;events like these
stand out from the Old Testament narrative and challenge
astonishment.</p>

<p>Of all these latter events, viewed as difficulties,&mdash;(for
it is as difficulties <i>in the way of Revelation</i> that we
are now expected to look on Miracles,)&mdash;you are requested
to observe that they enjoy, one and all, the
confirmation of <i>express citation in the New Testament</i>.
I am saying that either St. Paul, or St. Peter, or
St. James, or (above all) our Blessed <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>appeal to, or else explain, every one of these marvellous
passages in Old Testament History. And this is
the only remark I propose to offer concerning any of
them. It will certainly prove unavailing to convince
a certain class of persons of the historical reality of
the Deluge, to find that our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, that St. Peter,
and St. Paul, have all spoken of it as an actual event:&mdash;Men
who are disposed to reject the story of the dumb
ass speaking with man's voice, will not perhaps believe
it one whit the more because they find it appealed
to by St. Peter<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>:&mdash;and the Divine exposition
offered by <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself of Jonah, three days and
three nights in the fish's belly, will not, it may be
feared, reconcile others to an event which strikes
them as being too improbable to be true. But <i>this</i>,
at least, will infallibly result from the discovery:&mdash;men
will perceive that they must positively make
their election; and either accept the Bible as a whole,
or else reject it as a whole; for that there is no middle
course open to them. The New Testament stands
committed irrevocably to the Old. Every Book of the
Bible stands committed to all the other Books. Not
only does our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> quote the Canon in its collected
form, and call it "the Law and the prophets,"&mdash;or
simply &#7969; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8053;, "the Scripture,"&mdash;and so set His seal
upon it, as one undivided and indivisible roll of Inspiration;
but He and His Apostles single out the
very narratives which the imbecility of Man was
most likely to stumble at, and employ them for such
purposes, and in such a manner, that escape from
them shall henceforth be altogether hopeless. To
eliminate the marvels of Scripture, I say, is impossible;
for a Divine Hand has been laid upon almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>every one of them. The subsequent references are
not only most numerous, but they run into the very
staple of the narrative,&mdash;and will not,&mdash;<i>cannot</i> be
eradicated.</p>

<p>I question whether all students of the inspired page
are aware of the extent to which what I have been
saying holds true. Let me only invite you to investigate
the structure of the Bible under this aspect,
and you will be astonished at the result. For you
will find that the system of tacit quotation and allusive
reference is so perpetual, that it is as if the design
had been that the fibres should be incapable of being
disentangled any more. Balaam's story for example
in the Book of Numbers, is found alluded to in
Deuteronomy, in Joshua, in Micah, in Nehemiah; by
St. Peter, by St. Jude, and by St. John in the Apocalypse<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>.&mdash;The
Exodus, with its attendant wonders,
is alluded to in Joshua, and in Judges, and in Job,
and in the Psalms; in Amos, and Isaiah, and Micah,
and Hosea, and Jeremiah, and Daniel; in Kings, in
Samuel, in Nehemiah; and in the New Testament
repeatedly<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>. The Evangelists quote one another times
without number. In the Epistles, the Gospels are
quoted upwards of fifty times; and St. Peter quotes
St. Paul again and again. It is a favourite device of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>these last days to hint at the allegorical character of
the beginning of Genesis. But I find upwards of
thirty references in the New Testament to the first
two Chapters of Genesis<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>. Certain parts of Daniel
have incurred suspicion,&mdash;for no better reason, as it
seems, than because certain persons have found it
hard to believe that Prophecy can be "an anticipation
of History<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>." Now it is strange certainly to find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>a thing objected to for being what it is: and "Prophecy
is nothing <i>but</i> the history of events before they
come to pass,"&mdash;as Butler remarked long ago<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. Waiving
this, however, you are requested to observe that
our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> quotes from <i>those very parts of Daniel
which have been objected to</i>. You cannot get rid of
those parts of Daniel therefore. You are not to suppose
that the Bible is like an old house, where a
window may be darkened, or a door blocked up, according
to the caprice of every fresh occupant. The
terms on which men dwell there are that every part
of the structure shall be inhabited; and that every
part shall be retained in its integrity. What I am
insisting upon is, that the sacred Writers plainly say,&mdash;We
stand or we fall together. They reach forth
their hands, and they hold one another fast. They
rehearse comprehensive Genealogies,&mdash;they furnish
a summary view of long histories,&mdash;they enumerate
the various worthies of old time, and cite their deeds
in order. They recognize one another's voices, and
they interpret one another's thoughts, and they adopt
one another's sayings. Verily the Bible is <i>not</i> "like
any other Book!" The prophets and Apostles and
Evangelists of either covenant reach out one to another;
and lo, among them is seen the form of One
like the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>.... How far it may be rational
<i>to reject the Bible</i>, I will not now discuss: but it is
demonstrable that a man cannot accept the Bible, and
straightway propose to omit from it one jot or one
tittle of its contents. As for abstracting from Scripture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>the marvels of Scripture, it is precisely for the protection
and preservation of <i>them</i>, as I have been shewing,
that the most curious and abundant provision has
been made.</p>

<p>1. The miracles, properly so called, whether of the
Old or New Testament, have lately been cavilled at
with exceeding bitterness<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>. That they are sufficiently
attested, is allowed<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>; the objection is a (so called)
Philosophical one, and is briefly this,&mdash;that the Laws
of Nature being fixed and immutable, it is contrary
not only to experience, but also to reason, to suppose
that they have ever been suspended, or violated, or
interrupted. Events "contrary to the order of Nature,"&mdash;events
which would introduce "disorder"
into Creation,&mdash;are pronounced incredible.&mdash;This is
a very old objection; but it has been lately revived.
I will dispose of it as briefly as I can.</p>

<p>You are requested to observe then, that this difficulty,&mdash;(such
as it is,)&mdash;is entirely occasioned by the
terms in which it is stated. <i>Who</i> ever asserted that
Miracles are "violations of natural causes<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>?" "suspensions
of natural laws<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>?" Who ever said that the
effect of Miracles is to "interrupt"&mdash;"violate"&mdash;"reverse,"&mdash;the
Laws of Nature? Why assume "contrariety"
and "disorder" in a &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; which seems to
have had no experience of either?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
But <span class="smcap">God</span> is, I suppose, superior to His own Laws!
He is not the creature of circumstances,&mdash;even of His
own creating. Supreme is He in Creation,&mdash;albeit
in a manner which baffles thought. He does not
even suspend His Laws, perhaps, so much as fulfil
them after a Diviner fashion;&mdash;somewhat as He was
fulfilling the Mosaic Economy even while He seemed
to be violating one or other of its sanctions. He does
not reverse or disorder the fixed course of Nature, so
much as rise above it, and shew Himself superior to
it. He does not disturb anything, but our notions of
His mode of acting. <span class="smcap">God</span> coming suddenly to view
in Nature, (which is an essential part of the notion of
a miracle,) occasions perplexity, it is true; but only
because we do not understand fully either Nature or
<span class="smcap">God</span>. "We know Him not as He is, neither indeed
can know Him." While of Nature, we know nothing
but a few Laws which we have discovered by a long
and laborious induction of phenomena. In fact, this
whole manner of speaking concerning the Creator of
the Universe, with reference to the Laws which He
is found to have prescribed to things natural, has,
I suspect, some great foolishness in it: for, even if
we do not so far dishonour <span class="smcap">God</span> as to imagine that He
is subject to Law, yet we seem to imply that we
think ourselves capable of understanding the relation
in which He stands to Law. Whereas, the very
notion of Law may be utterly inapplicable to <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;who
is not only its first Author, (as He is indeed the
first Author of all things,) but the very source and
<i>cause</i> of it also. So that what are Laws to ourselves
may be not so much as Law at all to <span class="smcap">God</span>; but, (if
I may so speak,) something which depends on "the
counsel of His will," and which, (considered as a re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>straining
cause,) is to Him as if it were not. There
can be no miracles with <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>!</p>

<p>Briefly then:&mdash;That He who, (surely I may say
<i>confessedly</i>,) is above Law, when He manifests Himself
in the midst of Creation, should act in a manner
which defies conception; and yet should disturb nothing,
reverse nothing, violate nothing;&mdash;(except to
be sure, possibly, certain preconceived notions of His
rational creatures;)&mdash;in <i>this</i>, I say, there is surely
nothing either incredible or absurd.</p>

<p>2. So much, to say the truth, seems to be admitted,
by all but professed Atheists. But then, certain
formul&aelig; have been invented to bridge over the
difficulty, which Miracles are supposed to occasion,
which I cannot but think are just as objectionable as
unbelief itself.</p>

<p>By way of saving the credit of "the Laws of the
Universe," a kind of compromise has been discovered;
to which I do not find that <span class="smcap">God</span> has been made any
party.</p>

<p>The idea of Law, which has been falsely declared
to be only now "emerging into supremacy in Science<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>,"
seems to have usurped such a dominion over the
minds of a few persons, superficially acquainted with
Physical studies, that Miracles can be only tolerated
on the supposition that they are "the exact fulfilment
of much more extensive Laws than those we suppose
to exist<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>." We are kindly assured that what we call
a Miracle is not "an exception to those laws which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>we know, but really the fulfilment of a wider Law
which we did not know before<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>." Men are eager to
remind us that this is the view of Bp. Butler<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>, (whom
every one, I observe, is fond of having for an ally.)
Thus, a very recent writer says,&mdash;"What we call
interferences may, (as Bp. Butler observed long ago,)
be fulfilments of general laws not perfectly apprehended
by us<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>."&mdash;But I cannot find that Bp. Butler
anywhere says anything of the sort. What Butler
says, is,&mdash;that we know nothing of the laws of storms
and earthquakes,&mdash;tempers and geniuses;&mdash;yet we
conclude, (but only from analogy,) that all these seemingly
accidental things are the result of general laws.
Now, (he proceeds,) since it is only "from our finding
that the course of Nature, in some respects and so far,
goes on by general laws, that we conclude this of the
rest;"&mdash;it is credible "that <span class="smcap">God's</span> miraculous interpositions
may have been, all along, in like manner, <i>by
general laws of <span class="smcap">wisdom</span></i>." Butler says that it "may
have been by <i>general laws</i>," "that the affairs of the
world, being permitted to go on <i>in their natural course</i>
so far, should, just at such a point, have a new direction
given them <i>by miraculous interposition</i>." He does
not say, you observe, that those "miraculous interpositions"
are "the exact fulfilment of <i>much more extensive
Laws</i> than those we suppose to exist;" (as if
<i>a larger induction</i> were all that was needed, in order
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>to get rid of the obnoxious word "Miracle:")&mdash;not,
that Miracles may be "fulfilments of general laws
<i>not perfectly apprehended by us</i>;" (as if the only thing
wanted, were an enlargement of the human formula,
in order to bring a miraculous interposition within the
definition of an extraordinary phenomenon.) Such
notions belong altogether to the inventors of calculating
machines; whose speculations, even concerning
Divine things, clearly cannot soar above their instrument<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>.
It is called the "argument from laws intermitting<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>;"
and evidently reduces a miracle to a phenomenon
of periodical recurrence. The aloe, watched
for ninety-nine years and observed to blossom in the
hundredth, is (according to this view) an emblem of
the constitution of Nature at last interrupted by a
Miracle.</p>

<p>I will not waste your time further with this view
of the subject, having exposed its fallacy. Station
yourself, in thought, at the grave of Lazarus; and
see him that was dead and had been four days buried,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>come forth bound hand and foot with grave-clothes;&mdash;and
then prate of any "general Laws," except those
"<span class="smcap">of Wisdom</span>," to as many as you can get to listen to
you. A "miraculous interposition," (as Butler phrases
it,) has given a new direction to affairs which, so far,
had been permitted to go in their natural course.
That "general Laws" of inscrutable Wisdom determined
such a "<i>miraculous interposition</i>"&mdash;is a position
which, so far from objecting to, I embrace with both
the arms of my heart<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.</p>

<p>3. Another favourite recipe there is for escaping
from the bondage of Miracles, which is so childish,
that it would seem scarcely to deserve notice: but
that it has been largely resorted to by writers of whom
the world thinks highly. Those men, in a word, try to
<i>explain them away</i> where they can: where they cannot,
they <i>pare them down</i> as much as they are able, or
rather as much as they dare. Demoniacal possession?
Symptoms like those described are known to accompany
epilepsy. Manna? Something like it falls in the
wilderness of Sinai to this hour. The Red Sea parted?
Well, but a strong East wind blew all night. Stilling
the storm, and healing Peter's wife's mother? Every
storm is stilled if let alone; and a fever will burn
out, often without occasioning death. The miraculous
draught of fishes, and the stater in the fish's mouth?...
but you can readily supply a suggestion for
yourselves.</p>

<p>Now, two remarks present themselves on this kind
of handling, which may be worth stating. (1)&nbsp;Those
who so speak forget that the Devils are related to have
<i>conversed with <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i><a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>:&mdash;that the manna, (of which so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>many miraculous properties are related<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>,) fed 600,000
men for forty years, <i>and then suddenly ceased</i><a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>:&mdash;that
the waters of the Red Sea were <i>a wall to the children
of Israel, on their right hand and on their left</i><a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>:&mdash;that
when <span class="smcap">Christ</span> said to the waves of the sea of
Galilee "Peace, be still," "there was <i>a great calm</i><a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>:"&mdash;that
Peter's wife's mother, cured of her fever, "rose
and <i>ministered unto</i>," (that is "waited upon,") her
Benefactor<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>.... It is worse than absurd to explain
away <i>part</i> of a miracle, with a view to getting rid of
the whole of it: as if the essence of the miracle were
not sure to reside in the residuum,&mdash;in the very part
which is left unaccounted for! (2)&nbsp;But above all,
what place have such explanations in the recorded
cases of feeding the multitudes, opening the eyes of
one born blind, and raising the dead? While you
leave the chiefest miracles of the Gospel untouched,
you may not flatter yourself that you have got at the
kernel of the matter; or indeed that the real question
at issue has been touched by you, at all.</p>

<p>4. There remains to notice one subtle and most
treacherous method of dealing with the marvels of
Scripture,&mdash;(moral and physical alike,)&mdash;to which I
desire in conclusion to direct your special attention;
and which I would brand with burning words if I
had them at command. I allude to what is called
"<span class="smcap">Ideology</span>,"&mdash;the plain English for which term is,
<i>a denial of the historical reality of Scripture</i>. I will
not waste time with inquiring whether this method is
old or new. It is certainly much in fashion; and it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>is certainly finding advocates in high quarters. I
therefore make no apology for introducing the monstrous
thing to your notice. It requires, I should
hope, only to be understood, to be rejected with unqualified
indignation.</p>

<p>You and I, then, have been taught to believe that
"the <span class="smcap">Word</span> was made flesh and dwelt among us," in
the way St. Matthew and St. Luke describe: that our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> was Baptized and Tempted of Satan; that He
wrought Miracles,&mdash;casting out Devils, and even raising
the Dead; that He was Transfigured on a mountain;
that He was Crucified, died, and was buried; that He
rose again the Third Day, ascended into Heaven, and
at last, (as on this day,) sent down the <span class="smcap">Paraclete</span> to
dwell with His Church for ever. All this, I say, you
and I,&mdash;with the whole Church Catholic for 1800
years,&mdash;have been taught to believe as plain historical
truths, mere matters of fact; past telling wonderful
indeed, but yet as <i>historically true</i>, as that I am standing
here and you are sitting yonder,&mdash;neither more
nor less.</p>

<p>But you are to understand that we, and all mankind
with us, have been under a very curious delusion on
this head. We are assured that every one of these
things, or at least that some of them, are only <i>ideologically</i>
true: that <i>Historically</i>, they are false. In
plain language, we are requested to believe that they
never occurred at all. It is only a lively way of putting
it,&mdash;no more!</p>

<p>You will inevitably suppose that I must be trifling
with you: I therefore proceed to give you a sample of
this kind of teaching. A living dignitary of our Church
writes as follows concerning the Transfiguration of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>. "It may be asked, of what kind was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>vision which we here call the Transfiguration? Was
it an effect produced within on the minds of the Apostles;
or was it that an actual external change came
for the time over the person of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? We cannot
say." I give you this as the mildest form of the
poison. Quite evident is it that the same suggestion
is just as applicable to our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Birth, or to His
Death; to His Temptation, or to His Resurrection.
But to see whither all this <i>tends</i>, and what it really
<i>means</i>, you must have recourse to the pages of a more
advanced proficient in the Science of Ideology. He
admits that its "application to the interpretation of
Scripture, to the doctrines of Christianity, to the formularies
of the Church, may undoubtedly be pushed
so far as to leave in the sacred records <i>no historical
residue whatever</i>. An example of the critical ideology
carried to excess," (he says,) "<i>resolves into an ideal</i>"
the whole of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Life and Doctrine; and "<i>substitutes
a mere shadow</i> for the <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> of the Evangelists."
But for all that, (says the writer I am quoting,)
"there are traits in the Scriptural person of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
which are better explained by referring them to an ideal
than an historical origin: parts of Scripture are more
usefully interpreted ideologically than in any other
manner,&mdash;as for instance, the history of the Temptation
by Satan, and accounts of Demoniacal possession."
This writer, (who is a clergyman of the Church of
England, and a Graduate in Divinity,) goes on to
idealize the descent of Mankind from Adam and Eve,
together with the chiefest marvels of the Old Testament:
insisting that "the force, grandeur, and reality
of these ideas are not a whit impaired," although we
discredit and reject the history, <i>as</i> history. So, our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, (he says,) "is none the less the Son of David,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>in idea and spiritually, even if it be unproved whether
He were so in historic fact." "The spiritual significance
is still the same," (he says,) "of the Transfiguration,
of opening blind eyes, of causing the tongue
of the stammerer to speak plainly, of feeding multitudes
with bread in the wilderness, of cleansing
leprosy,&mdash;whatever links may be deficient in the traditional
record of particular events."</p>

<p>"Whatever links may be deficient!" O that men
would have the courage or the honesty to <i>say</i> what
they <i>mean</i>! Why not say plainly, "<i>however untrustworthy
we may account the narrative to be</i>?" And this
writer cannot mean any other thing; for missing
"links," assuredly, there are <i>none</i>.&mdash;In truth this method
of wrapping up a monstrous abortion in "purple
and fine linen," in order to make it look like "a proper
child," is so much in vogue, that plain men are obliged
first to <i>translate</i> a fallacy in order to understand it.
Thus, a recent Apologist for the very writer I have
been quoting,&mdash;after surrendering the beginning of
Genesis as "parabolic," (that is, <i>not historically true</i>,)
is yet so obliging as to contend that "there still remain
events" in Scripture,&mdash;our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Resurrection
to wit,&mdash;"in which the garb of flesh,"&mdash;(pray mark
the phraseology!)&mdash;"in which <i>the garb of flesh</i> seems to
be so indispensable a vehicle for the spirit within, that
we can hardly conceive how the one could have sustained
itself in the world, unless it had been from the
beginning allied to the other<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>." In plain English,
the writer is so candid as to admit that if the Resurrection
of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span> from death be a mere
fabrication,&mdash;in plain terms, a hoax practised upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>credulity of an unscientific age,&mdash;it is hard to understand
how it can have <i>imposed</i> upon mankind so completely
for the last eighteen hundred years.</p>

<p>I will not insult the understanding of those who hear
me so grossly as to suppose that dreams like these,&mdash;(and
really they are no more!)&mdash;require answer or
refutation. Such desperate shifts to elude the meaning
of plain words, as the whole theory of Ideology
discloses, would be even ludicrous, if the subject-matter
were not so very sacred and solemn. As in the
case of certain acts of flagrant dishonesty which one
sometimes reads of,&mdash;one cannot forbear exclaiming,
The man must certainly have felt himself <i>very sore
pressed indeed</i> to have been induced to resort to a step
so utterly disgraceful to his character!... Anyhow,
since certain persons have adopted this course, I do
but plead for consistency. Only let them be sure
that they apply this precious method of Interpretation
to the History of England, and to everything their
friend tells them: and let them not feel surprised if
the same kind of ideological handling is bestowed
upon everything they tell their friend. Idealize away,
and be sure you stick at nothing! <i>Why</i> be outdone
in logical consistency by such an one as Strauss? Let
men also make their election whether Scripture shall
be a lie or not. And when they have made up their
minds, let them, in the Name of <span class="smcap">God</span>, instead of
dealing in unmanly insinuations, and dark hints, and
shuffling equivocations,&mdash;let them declare themselves
plainly, that we may know at least <i>with whom</i> and
<i>with what</i> we have to do. For while false Brethren
are thus playing fast and loose with Revelation, they
are trifling with the faith of thousands,&mdash;and imperilling
other immortal souls besides their own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
But I shall be reminded that the subject-matter of
daily life, and of the Everlasting Gospel, is very different:
and that the marvellous character of certain
events recorded in the Bible constrains us to relegate
those events to a distinct region. A child's plea,
which was effectually disposed of upwards of a century
ago! What does it amount to but this,&mdash;that what
is <i>supernatural</i>, or even highly extraordinary, must
be also untrue?... When, however, the argument is
shifted, and is made an appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i>:&mdash;when
I am entreated to remember that though <i>I</i> believe
in the Resurrection of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> from Death, the
same event is a "stumbling block" to many; and
that I am "bound to treat with tenderness those who
prefer to lean on the other, and, as <i>they</i> think, <i>more
secure foundation</i><a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>;" (viz. on the hypothesis that the
Resurrection of the Son of Man is all a fable;)&mdash;I say,
when I am so addressed, really, friends and Brethren,
I am constrained to cry out that there is a limit beyond
which Nature cannot endure; and that <i>that</i>
limit has now been overstepped. Will men try to
persuade us that <i>the idea</i> of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Resurrection
is a more secure basis for the Church's faith than <i>the
fact</i> of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Resurrection? Why, they might
as well try to convince the world that a broken reed
is a better support than an oaken staff;&mdash;or that a
handful of waste paper is of more value than the title-deeds
of an estate. How <i>can</i> a shadow,&mdash;how <i>can</i>
what is confessedly an imagination,&mdash;be, in any sense,
or for any body, a "secure foundation;" or indeed,
<i>any foundation at all</i>? how, above all, can a fancy be
a "<i>more</i> secure foundation" than <i>a fact</i>?... Not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>only will I <i>not</i> treat men with tenderness who put
forth such blasphemous folly,&mdash;(men who, in their
rashness, their recklessness, their arrogance, shew no
manner of tenderness or consideration for others!)&mdash;but
I will hold them up to ridicule, to the very utmost
of my power. Nay, I would make them objects of
unqualified reprobation to all, if I could, as they deserve
to be reprobated; for they are the worst enemies
of the Gospel of <span class="smcap">Christ</span><a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. "If <span class="smcap">Christ</span> be not
risen, then is our preaching vain, <i>and your faith is
vain also</i><a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>!" "The Apostle <i>rests the truth of the Christian
Religion</i> on the fact that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was risen....
The whole system turns upon this central point; the
several doctrines gather round it, they depend upon
it, they grow out of it; so that without it, Christianity
would have no coherence or meaning<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>."</p>

<p>You and I know very well "that nothing could
more effectually shake the whole fabric of Revealed
Religion, than thus converting its history into fable,
and its realities into fiction. For if the narratives most
usually selected for the purpose may thus be explained
away; what part of the Sacred History will be secure
against similar treatment? Nay, what doctrines,
even those the most essential to Christianity, might
not thus be undermined? For are not those doctrines
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>dependent upon the <i>facts</i> recorded in Scripture for the
evidence of their truth? Does not, for instance, the
whole system of our Redemption presuppose the reality
of the Fall as an historical fact? And do not the
proofs of the Divine authority of the whole, rest upon
the verification of its Prophecies and Miracles, as
events which have actually taken place? Allegory
thus misapplied is therefore worse than frivolous or
useless; it strikes a deadly blow at the very vitals of
the Christian Faith<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>." Away then with that very
questionable form of liberality, which makes most
free with <i>what belongs to <span class="smcap">God</span></i>! The truths of Revelation
are yours and mine, I grant you: but only <i>so</i>
yours and mine that, to our eternal blessedness, we
embrace,&mdash;to our eternal loss, we let them slip! We
add to them, or we take away from them, under peril
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> curse.... Away too with that mawkish sentimentality
which can find no better object for its
sympathy than the hardened blasphemer, and the confirmed
sceptic! <i>My</i> sympathy shall be reserved for
those who have never so offended, but are, on the
contrary, full of precious promise;&mdash;for the young
and as yet inexperienced;&mdash;for <i>you</i>, who will have the
battle of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and His Church to fight, when <i>we</i>
shall be mouldering in the grave. Let those who do
not know me, deem me uncharitable if they will. I
care not. The uncharitable man,&mdash;mark me, Brethren!&mdash;the
truly uncharitable man, is he, who shews
no consideration for weak and unstable souls; who
does not regard the trials and perils of the young;
who beguiles unsteady feet to the edge of the precipice,
and there forsakes them; whose destructive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>method, (for constructiveness is no part of that man's
philosophy!)&mdash;whose destructive method leaves the
young without chart and compass,&mdash;aye, without moon
or stars to sail by; who labours hard to communicate
the taint of his own foul leprosy to those who were
before unpolluted; who dims the eye, and deadens the
ear, and defiles the thoughts, and darkens the hope
of as many as have the misfortune to come in his
way, and feels no pity!&mdash;Yes, yes! The man who
sows his own vile doubts broadcast over two continents,&mdash;doing
his very best to destroy the faith of
those for whom <span class="smcap">Christ</span> died,&mdash;he, <i>he</i> is the uncharitable
man<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>! Not he who, forsaking the flowery fields
of the Gospel, (whither he would far, far rather lead
you!) and foregoing the free mountain air of imperishable
Truth, for your sakes only keeps treading these
dreary stifling paths of speculation;&mdash;a friend of yours,
I mean, who with stammering eloquence, (the more's
the pity!) clings thus to you, Sunday after Sunday,&mdash;imploring
you, with all a brother's earnestness, not to
venture where to venture is to die; and warning you
against the men who have conspired against your <i>life</i>;&mdash;even
while he labours hard to shew you what he
<i>knows</i> to be "a more excellent way;" and implores
you to come where <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself hath promised
that "ye shall find rest to your souls!"</p>

<p>This is all there is time for, to-day. Let me, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>the fewest possible words, gather up what has been
spoken into a practical shape.</p>

<p>Friends and brethren,&mdash;(I am still addressing the
younger men present!)&mdash;Divinity is not debate; and
Religion is not controversy; and Life is not long
enough for perpetual disputings. "He that cometh
unto <span class="smcap">God</span> must believe that <i>He is</i>." The heart dries
up, and the affections wither away, and the soul
faints, amid an atmosphere of cloudy doubts, and
captious difficulties, and perverse disputations. You
must rise above it, if you would discern the colours
on the everlasting hills, and behold the beauty of the
promised Land, and see objects as they really are.
O put away from yourselves, (if any of you are so
unhappy as to have acquired it,) a habit of mind
which will effectually unfit you for profiting by what
you read in Holy Scripture: and you, who are free
from such dreadful bondage, beware lest, by the indulgence
of some sin,&mdash;whether of the flesh or of the
spirit,&mdash;you darken that spiritual eye by which alone
spiritual things are to be discerned. It is like talking
about colours to the blind, or about sounds to the
deaf, to discuss with a certain class of persons the
Inspiration, or the Interpretation, or the Marvels of
Scripture. The Bible is, with them, <i>a common book</i>,&mdash;"to
be <i>interpreted like any other book</i>." Prophecy is
denied, and Miracles are rejected or explained away,&mdash;on
the plea that they are alike incredible. These
men lay claim to intellectual gifts above their fellows;
and know not that they are "wretched, and miserable,
and poor, and blind, and naked." Rebels are
they against the Most High; and find their exact
image in those citizens who "sent a message after
Him, saying, We will not have this Man to reign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>over us<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>." The gist of all they deliver, is <i>rebellion
against <span class="smcap">God</span></i>.</p>

<p>But it is not so with yourselves, who have yet
everything to learn in respect of Divine things. O beware
lest it ever become your own dreadful case!
Begin betimes to acquaint yourselves with the wealth
of that celestial armoury which contains a weapon
which must prove fatal to every foe; but which it
depends <i>on yourselves</i> whether you shall have the skill
to wield or not. Suffer not yourselves to be cheated
of your birthright, the Bible, either by the novel
fictions of unstable men, or by the exploded heresies
of a bygone age, revived and recommended by living
unbelievers. You, especially, who aspire to the Ministerial
office, and are destined hereafter to undertake
the cure of souls, O do you be doubly watchful! Give
to the Bible the undivided homage of a childlike
heart; and bow down before its revelations with
a suppliant understanding also; and let no characteristic
of its method by any means escape you.
Notice how it is indeed all one long narrative, from
end to end; and see therein <span class="smcap">God's</span> provision that
nothing shall be idealized, nothing explained away.
Learn too that Man is thus called upon to look outward,
and to sustain himself by an external Law; <i>not</i>
to depend on the promptings of his own conscience,
and so to become a god unto himself. The Bible,
I repeat, is all severest history, from the Alpha to the
Omega of it. But then, underneath the surface there
are meanings high as Heaven, deep as Hell: and why?
because <i>the true Author of it is not Man, but <span class="smcap">God</span></i>!</p>

<p>Let it quicken you in your desire to understand
that Book out of which you will have hereafter to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>preach, reprove, rebuke, exhort<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>,&mdash;sometimes to bethink
yourselves of the flocks which already are expecting
you; and among which <span class="smcap">God</span> already sees your
future going out and coming in; your faithful teaching,
or (<span class="smcap">God</span> forbid!) your betrayal of a most sacred
trust. Acquaint yourselves in due time, by all means,
with the scientific grounds on which the Bible is to
be received as the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>: but of a truth, hereafter,
you will forget to require that external testimony;
for you will be convinced of its Divine origin,
when you have become the adoring witnesses of its
Divine power. Truly <i>that</i> must be from <span class="smcap">God</span> which
can so change the life and affect the heart; which can
sustain the spirit under bereavement, and become the
soul's satisfying portion under every form of adversity!
It has already altered the aspect of the World;
and it has still a mighty work to do in India, and in
China, and in Africa, and in the Islands of the Sea.</p>

<p>Difficulties there are in Scripture, doubtless: but
I should be far more perplexed by the absence of
them, than I shall ever be by their presence. Nay,
they are a chief source of joy to a rightly constituted
mind; for they exercise the moral nature and the
intellectual powers, in the noblest possible way. It
is the office of the highest Intellect to know when to
walk <i>by Faith</i>, and when <i>by sight</i>: and when, to "ask
for the old paths." It needs a mind of no common
order fully to recognize the distinctive difference between
a system which comes from <span class="smcap">God</span>; and one
which has been elaborated by human Reason: the
latter progressive,&mdash;the former incapable of progress;
the one liable to change,&mdash;the other, unchangeable for
ever. There are certain indelible characteristics of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>a Divine Revelation, I say, which it is the office of
the keenest wit to detect and hold fast,&mdash;which it is
a prime note of imbecility in a thoughtful man to
overlook and let go.... The Bible in truth, as one
grows older,&mdash;(to me at least it seems so,)&mdash;becomes
almost the only thing in the world really deserving
of a man's attention. <i>Above</i> Reason, many things in
it confessedly are: but <i>against</i> Reason, I do not know
of <i>one</i>. Meantime, is it not a glorious anticipation for
you and for me, that to understand those hard things
fully may be hereafter a part of our chiefest bliss?
There is but a step between us and death<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>; and assuredly

writer to whom, more than to any other person, I conceive that
we are indebted for "Essays and Reviews;" <i>that</i> unhappy production
being the lawful development and inevitable result of the late
Head-master of Rugby's most unsound and mischievous religious
teaching:)&mdash;"It is a very misleading notion of Prophecy, if we
regard it as an anticipation of History." (<i>Sermons</i>, i. p.&nbsp;375.)
"I think that, with the exception of those prophecies which relate
to our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the object of Prophecy is rather to delineate principles
and states of opinion which shall come, than external events.
I grant that Daniel <i>seems to furnish an exception</i>." (<i>Life and
Correspondence</i>, p.&nbsp;59.) This was written in 1825. In 1840, we
are informed:&mdash;"The latter chapters of Daniel, <i>if genuine, would
be a clear exception to my Canon of Interpretation</i>.... But I have
long thought that the greater part of the Book of Daniel is most
certainly a very late work, of the time of the Maccabees; and the
<i>pretended prophecy</i> about the Kings of Grecia and Persia, and of
the North and South, is <i>mere history, like the poetical prophecies in
Virgil and elsewhere</i>.... That there may be genuine fragments in
it, is very likely." (<i>Ibid.</i>, p.&nbsp;505.)&mdash;In other words, Dr. Arnold,
rather than suppose "<i>my</i> Canon of Interpretation"&nbsp;(!) worthless,
is prepared to eject the Book of Daniel from the Inspired Canon.
Any thing is "very likely," in short, except that God could foretell
future events, and Dr. Arnold be in error!... &#7950;&#961;' &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#8021;&#946;&#961;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8049;&#948;';</p></div>

<p>[<i>Bishop Horsley on the double sense of Prophecy.</i>]</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"I shall not wonder, if, to those who have not sifted this
question to the bottom, (which few, I am persuaded, have
done,) the evidence of a Providence, arising from prophecies
of this sort<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>, should appear to be very slender, or none at
all. Nor shall I scruple to confess, that time was when I
was myself in this opinion, and was therefore much inclined
to join with those who think that every prophecy, were it
rightly understood, would be found to carry a precise and
single meaning; and that, wherever the double sense appears,
it is because the one true sense hath not yet been
detected. I said,&mdash;'Either the images of the prophetic style
have constant and proper relations to the events of the world,
as the words of common speech have proper and constant
meanings, or they have not. If they have, then it seems no
less difficult to conceive that many events should be shadowed
under the images of one and the same prophecy, than that
several likenesses should be expressed in a single portrait.
But, if the prophetic images have no such appropriate relations
to things, but that the same image may stand for many
things, and various events be included in a single prediction,
then it should seem that prophecy, thus indefinite in its
meaning, con afford no proof of Providence: for it should
seem possible, that a prophecy of this sort, by whatever
principle the world were governed, whether by Providence,
Nature, or Necessity, might owe a seeming completion to
mere accident.' And since it were absurd to suppose that
the Holy Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span> should frame prophecies by which
the end of Prophecy might so ill be answered, it seemed
a just and fair conclusion, that no prophecy of holy writ
might carry a double meaning.</p>

<p>"Thus I reasoned, till a patient investigation of the subject
brought me, by <span class="smcap">God's</span> blessing, to a better mind. I
stand clearly and unanswerably confuted, by the instance of
Noah's prophecy concerning the family of Japheth; which
hath actually received various accomplishments, in events of
various kinds, in various ages of the world,&mdash;in the settlements
of European and Tartarian conquerors in the Lower
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>Asia; in the settlements of European traders on the coasts
of India; and in the early and plentiful conversion of the
families of Japheth's stock to the faith of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. The application
of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all
the characteristics of a true interpretation,&mdash;consistence with
the terms of the prophecy, consistence with the truth of history,
consistence with the prophetic system. Every one of
these events must therefore pass, with every believer, for
a true completion."</p></div>

with regard to the exercise of our understanding
upon the subject of Religion, as we are with regard to our
behaviour in common affairs. The former is as much a
thing within our power and choice as the latter."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Nor does there appear any absurdity in supposing, that
the speculative difficulties, in which the evidence of Religion
is involved, may make even the principal part of some persons'
trial. For as the chief temptations of the generality of
the world are the ordinary motives to injustice or unrestrained
pleasure; or to live in the neglect of Religion from
that frame of mind, which renders many persons almost
without feeling as to any thing distant, or which is not the
object of their senses: so there are other persons without this
shallowness of temper, persons of a deeper sense as to what
is invisible and future; who not only see, but have a general
practical feeling, that what is to come will be present, and
that things are not less real for their not being the objects
of sense; and who, from their natural constitution of body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>and of temper, and from their external condition, may have
small temptations to behave ill, small difficulty in behaving
well, in the common course of life. Now when these latter
persons have a distinct full conviction of the truth of Religion,
without any possible doubts or difficulties, the practice
of it is to them unavoidable, unless they will do a constant
violence to their own minds; and religion is scarce any more
a discipline to them, than it is to creatures in a state of perfection.
Yet these persons may possibly stand in need of
moral discipline and exercise in a higher degree, than they
would have by such an easy practice of religion. Or it may
be requisite for reasons unknown to us, that they should give
some further manifestation what is their moral character, to
the creation of <span class="smcap">God</span>, than such a practice of it would be.
Thus in the great variety of religious situations in which
men are placed, what constitutes, what chiefly and peculiarly
constitutes, the probation, in all senses, of some persons,
may be the difficulties in which the evidence of religion
is involved: and their principal and distinguished trial may
be, how they will behave under and with respect to these
difficulties."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bishop Butler</span>'s <i>Analogy</i>, P. <span class="smcap">ii.</span> ch. vi. (ed.
1833,) p.&nbsp;266. and pp.&nbsp;274-5.</p></div>

<p>Further on, (p.&nbsp;277,) Butler has the following note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dan. xii. 10. See also Is. xxix. 13, 14: St. Matth. vi.

<p>[<i>St.&nbsp;Stephen's Statement in Acts vii. 15, 16, explained.</i>]</p>


<p>In a work like the present which purports to deal solely
with the grander features of <span class="smcap">Inspiration</span> and <span class="smcap">Interpretation</span>,
it is clearly impossible to enter systematically into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>details of any kind. If, here and there, something like
minuteness has been attempted<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>, it has only been by way
of sample of what one would fain have done,&mdash;of what one
would fain do,&mdash;time and place and occasion serving. In
the same spirit I will add a few remarks on the famous passage
in Acts vii. 15, 16; for, confessedly, to a common eye
it <i>seems</i> to contain several erroneous statements. The words,
as they stand in our English Bible, are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our
Fathers; and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in
the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of
the sons of Emmor <i>the father</i> of Sychem."</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, it will be convenient to have under
our eyes, at the same time, the original of the passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#922;&#945;&#964;&#8051;&#946;&#951; &#948;&#8050; &#7992;&#945;&#954;&#8060;&#946; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#913;&#7988;&#947;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8059;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054;

<p>On this, Dr. Alford, Dean of Canterbury, delivers himself
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is certainly, and that not dependent upon any
Rabbinical or Jewish views of the subject, an inaccuracy in
Stephen's statement: for the burying-place was not at
Sychem which Abraham bought, but at Hebron, and it was
bought of Ephron the Hittite, as you will find in the 23rd
of Genesis from the 7th to the 20th verses. It is not worth
while for us now to read the account, but so it is: Abraham
bought a field at Hebron of Ephron the Hittite. There is
no mention at all made of its being for a burying-place.
But it was Jacob who bought a field near Shechem 'of the
children of Hamor, Shechem's father.' These two incidents,
then, in this case are confused together. And again I say,
if it is necessary to say it again, that there is no reason at
all for us to be ashamed of such a statement&mdash;no reason for
us to be afraid of it, or in any way staggered at it. It was
not Stephen's purpose to give an accurate history of the
children of Israel, but to derive results from that history,
which remain irrefragable, whatever the details which he
alleged."&mdash;<i>Homilies on the former part of the Acts of the
Apostles</i>, by Henry Alford, B.D., Dean of Canterbury,
London, 1858, p.&nbsp;219.</p>

<p>A northern Professor, (Patrick Fairbairn, D.D., Principal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>and Professor of Divinity in the Free Church College,
Glasgow,) also writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, there can be no doubt, that viewing the matter
critically and historically, there <i>are</i> inaccuracies in this statement;
for we know from the records of Old Testament history,
that Jacob's body was not laid in a sepulchre at Sychem,
but in the cave of Machpelah at Hebron;&mdash;we know also
that the field, which was bought of the sons of Emmor, or
the children of Hamor (as they are called in Gen. xxxiii. 19),
the father of Sichem, was bought, not by Abraham, but by
Jacob."&mdash;<i>Hermeneutical Manual, or Introduction to the Exegetical
Study of the Scriptures of the New Testament</i>, &amp;c.
Edinburgh, 1858, p.&nbsp;101.</p>

<p>Now when it is considered that the speaker here was
St.&nbsp;Stephen,&mdash;a man who is said to have been "full of the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>," so that "no one could resist the wisdom and
the spirit by which he spake," (Acts vi. 3, 5, 8, 10.)&mdash;there
is evidently the greatest <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> unreasonableness in so
handling his words. But let the adverse criticism be submitted
to the test of a searching analysis; and how transparently
fallacious is it found to be!</p>

<p>First, we have to ascertain the <i>meaning</i> of the passage.
And it is evident to every one having an ordinary acquaintance
with Greek, that the words &#7960;&#956;&#956;&#8056;&#961; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#931;&#965;&#967;&#8050;&#956;
<i>cannot</i> mean "Emmor <i>the father</i> of Sychem." This is a mere
mistranslation, as the invariable usage of the New Testament
shews. The genitive denotes <i>dependent</i> relation. The Vulgate
rightly supplies the word "filii;" and there can be no
doubt whatever that what St.&nbsp;Stephen says, is, that Abraham
bought the burial-place "of the sons of Emmor, <i>the son</i>
of Sychem."</p>

<p>Next, it is evident that "our Fathers," (&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#949;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;,)
<i>exclusive of Jacob</i>, form the nominative to the verb "were
carried over" (&#956;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#964;&#8051;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;.) In English, the place ought
to be exhibited as follows:&mdash;"he and our Fathers; and <i>they</i>
were carried." But, in truth, the idiom of the original is so
easy, to one familiar with the manner of the sacred writers<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>;
and the historical fact so exceedingly obvious; that it must
have been felt by St. Luke, in recording St.&nbsp;Stephen's words,
that greater minuteness of statement was quite needless.
Who remembers not the affecting details of where Jacob was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>to be buried, as well as the circumstantial narrative of whither
his sons conveyed his bones<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>? <i>Who</i> remembers not also
that the bones of Joseph, (and, as we learn from this place,
the rest with him,) were carried up out of Egypt by the
children of Israel, at the Exode<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>?</p>

<p><i>Where</i> then is the supposed difficulty? Moses relates (in
Gen. xxiii.) that Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite,
the son of Zohar, the field and the cave of Machpelah: and
says that Machpelah was before Mamre, otherwise called
Kirjath-Arba, and Hebron. St.&nbsp;Stephen further relates that
Abraham bought the sepulchre at Sychem in which the
Twelve Patriarchs were eventually buried, of the sons of
Emmor, (or Hamor.) May not the same man buy two estates?</p>

<p>True enough it is that Jacob, when he came from Padan
Aram, "bought a parcel of a field" at "Shalem a city of
Shechem," "at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's
father." But there is no pretence for saying that these last
two transactions are identical, and have been here confused
together: for the sellers, in the one case, were "the sons of
Emmor, <i>the son</i> of Sychem;" and in the other, "the children
of Hamor,"&mdash;<i>father of that Shechem whose tragic end is
related in Gen. xxxiv.</i>: while the buyer was in the one case,
Abraham; in the other case, Jacob. Not to be tedious however,
let me in a few words, state what was the evident truth
of the present History.</p>

<p>It is found that Jacob, in order to build an altar at
Shechem with security, judged it expedient to purchase the
field whereon it should stand. Who can doubt that the
purchase was a measure of necessity also? If, at the present
day, one desired to erect a church on some spot in India,
where the value of land was fully ascertained<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>, and where
there were many inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>,&mdash;how would it be possible to
set about the work, with the remotest purpose of retaining
possession, unless one first <i>bought</i> the ground on which the
structure was to stand? I infer that when Abraham first
halted at Sichem<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>, and built an altar there<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>, (the Canaanite
being then in the land,) <i>it is very likely</i> that <i>he</i> bought the
ground also. But when St.&nbsp;Stephen informs me that the
thing which <i>I</i> think only <i>probable</i>, was <i>a matter of fact</i>; am
I, (with Dean Alford,) to hesitate about believing him?
Abraham then, in the first instance, bought Sichem, Shechem,
or Sychar; and there built an altar. To that same
spot, long after, his grandson Jacob resorted. What wonder,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>since the wells of Abraham were stopped during his absence,
and had to be recovered by his son, (as related in Gen. xxvi.
17-22,)&mdash;what wonder, I say, if Jacob, on coming to Shechem
after an interval of nearly 200 years, finds that he also
must renew the purchase of the cherished possession? The
importance of that locality, and the sacred interest attaching
to it, has been explained in a <i>Plain Commentary on the Gospels</i>,
on St. John iv. 1-6, and 41. See also a Sermon by the same
author,&mdash;<i>One Soweth and another Reapeth</i>.</p>

<p>(p.&nbsp;74.)</p>

<p>[<i>The simplest view of Inspiration the truest and the best.</i>]</p>


<p>"I suppose all thoughtful persons will allow that intellectual
licentiousness is the danger of this our intellectual age.
For speculation indulges our pride. Faith is an inglorious
thing; any one can believe, a cottager just as well as a
philosopher: but not all can speculate. The privilege of an
intellectually advanced person is that. And the more novel
the view he offers, the more evident the proof it gives of an
independent mind. Therefore the danger of a highly advanced
state of society like our own, is Theory, as distinguished
from Catholic Truth. And the most inviting field
of theory, is that high subject, the intercourse which hath
gone on between the Intellect above us, and our own; the
communications which have been made from the Creator to
His creatures. In a word, man is under a temptation to
frame a theory of Inspiration; whether his attempts to frame
one have been successful, is a matter of much interest to
consider.</p>

<p>"I am going to offer a few plain remarks on what the
Bible professes to be. I say, professes to be, because those
whom I speak to will believe that what it professes to be, it
is. I mean they will not suspect the writers of any dishonesty
or ambitious pretence. But there may be some
readers of the Bible, among persons whose profession is the
exercise of the intellect, who are impatient at being left behind
in the intellectual race; who, when continental critics
are going on into theories of inspiration, do not like the imputation
(so freely cast upon us by foreign writers) of being
unequal to such things, of having no turn for philosophy.
So they must have a theory, or go along with one; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
must receive the Bible,&mdash;for they do receive it,&mdash;in some intellectual
way; through some lens which they hold up; with
a consciousness of some intellectual action in receiving it,
something which not every one could practise, something
beyond the mere simple apprehension of terms, and simple
faith in embracing propositions.</p>

<p>"But in striking contrast with all such views and all such
desires, stands the singular character of the sacred volume
itself. It manifestly addresses itself to a mind in an attitude
of much simplicity; to a mind coming to receive a theory,
not to hold up one; coming to be shaped, not holding out
a mould to shape a communication made. For it presents
itself as a document containing a message from on high; as
conveying the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>; nor can all that is ever said on
the subject get beyond this plain account of its contents, 'the
Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>.' Nor need any one who desires to impress on
his own mind and that of others the true character of the
sacred page, try to do more than to remind himself that it
professes to convey to him the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i> by
the Rev. C.&nbsp;P. Eden, pp.&nbsp;148-150.</p>

<p>"What I desire to impress upon myself and those who
hear me is this, that the words of <span class="smcap">God</span> are always perfect,
always complete; and that the feeling with which a poor
cottager sits down to his Bible is the right one, and that the
student hath the best hope of successful study who in attitude
of mind is most likened to him."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p.&nbsp;192.</p>

<p>"The conclusion, then, is this; that Faith hath not been
wrong through these many years, in her simple acceptance
of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word. To come round to simplicity, is what we
have always had to do in the great questions of Divinity.
There have been great questions; they have agitated the
Church; but, as I said, to come round to simplicity hath ever
been her work first or last. When in the fourth century
men refined upon the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and
Arians and semi-Arians would be telling us <i>how</i> these things
could be, the unity of <span class="smcap">God</span> in three Persons; to come round
to the simplicity of the Athanasian doctrine, and to disown
the several explanatory statements which, offering to explain,
explained away, was the Church's work. I am not sure that
since the clays of the Arian dispute, a more important question
has arisen than that which seems likely to be ere long
forcing itself upon us, of the Inspiration of Holy Writ. I
freely permit myself to anticipate that the simplest possible
view of the subject, that on which rich and poor may meet
together, is the one to which we shall come round."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>,
pp.&nbsp;172-3.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>(p.&nbsp;107.)</p>

<p>[<i>The written and the Incarnate Word.</i>]</p>


<p>"I suppose we all have learned from the language used
by the Evangelist St. John, always to look on each of these
two employments of the expression, (the <span class="smcap">Word of God</span>,)
with reference to the other; and to see in each, the other
also. I shall not attempt to express more definitely this connexion;
I only need to suppose that we all apprehend it as
existing. But I shall claim from it thus much to my present
purpose;&mdash;that as He whom the Evangelist saw riding
in the heavenly pomp on high, and who was revealed to him
as bearing this title, 'The <span class="smcap">Word</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span><a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>,' was the same who
rode as at this time into Jerusalem; in humiliation here, in
glory there; here veiled, there in brightness unveiled:&mdash;I
would now associate the two, and would regard that sacred
volume which the poor cottager knows as the 'Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>,'
as placed under the same dispensation; as veiled here, reserved
for Revelation hereafter. I say, as all the other circumstances
of our condition are certainly to be regarded in
this aspect, viz., as things waiting for development; so
ordered by a Divine wisdom as that they shall sustain faith
and instruct piety now, but shall shew themselves for what
they are, (if ever to a created being, yet) only in a later
stage than that to which they were given as its present religious
provision: as other things, so the written page (I
will assume) which speaks of <span class="smcap">God</span>. I assume that in this
world we are using sounds which mean more than we know.
I assume that in our churches we are in the highest sense
singing the songs of Sion, of the future and heavenly Sion.
If Saints in Heaven shall sing (as we are told they shall)
the song of Moses, then the song of Moses is already a song
for Heaven; only <i>there</i> we shall know its meaning, or more
of it than now we do. And the use which I make of the reflection
is, to suggest (as I said) the frame of mind in which
we should approach the consideration of the sacred page;
such a frame of mind as that no future revelations of the import
of that page shall have power to reproach us as having
dishonoured it by our interpretations here, and having betrayed
an inadequate feeling of what Inspiration was."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>,

<p>[<i>The volume of the Old Testament Scriptures, indivisible.</i>]</p>


<p>"In regard of the Old Testament, it will be observed that
the whole volume stands or falls altogether. In whatever
sense we understand the falling or standing, the volume
stands or falls together. Each page of it is committed to the
credit of the rest, and the whole book or collection of books
is committed to the credit of each page. For this plain reason,
that the book as we have it, is the book which, being
known in the Jewish Church as the volume of her authentic
and sacred Scriptures, our blessed <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> accepted and referred
to as such. By whatever marks the canonicity of
the several books was in the first instance attested,&mdash;marks
which were sufficient for <span class="smcap">God's</span> purpose, and which did His
work,&mdash;<i>there</i> is the volume. 'It is written,' said our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>;
that is, in a book which all His nation knew of, and
understood to be inspired. The scrupulous care which the
Jews shewed in preserving their sacred writings intact, is one
of the most remarkable facts in history; it is a fact of which
the Christian student can give perhaps the right account,
seeing it to have been so ordered in the good providence of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, that we might have firm ground in calling the book, as
we have it, the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>. The volume stands or falls
then together; which we may with advantage bear in mind,
because it makes an argument which is available for any
portion of the volume, available for the whole; and no one
can now say, 'You do not surely hold the genealogies in the
books of Chronicles, to be inspired: Isaiah and the Psalms
may be inspired; but do you mean the same of the long extracts
from mere annals?' No man, I say, can take this
freedom, until he can extract and remove those chapters
from the book which our blessed <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> unquestionably referred
to as the canonical Scriptures of the Church. If
a verse stands, the Old Testament stands."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>, by the

<p>[<i>Remarks on Theories of Inspiration.&mdash;The 'Human
Element</i>.']</p>


<p>"It will be allowed by all persons accustomed to a calm
and charitable view of Theological differences, that in those
differences there is generally on each side some great truth
wrongly held, because taken out of its due place, and wrongly
set. Applying this topic to the subject before us, we are led
to consider whether a mistake has not been made in bringing
forward the Human Element of Inspiration, instead of
permitting the eye to rest upon that which <span class="smcap">God</span> presents to
us,&mdash;the Divine. The Human Element no doubt is there;
no doubt our Maker acts through our faculties in every
respect; no doubt He is acting through laws when He seems
to suspend laws; and even in Miracles, employs the powers
of Nature instead of thwarting them; but then this is His
machinery, which He has not explained to us. He presents
Himself to us, acting sometimes supernaturally; i.e. in a way
above nature as we understand nature. He made the Sun
to stand still for Joshua; what refractive cloud came in and
held the daylight that it should not go down is not made
known to us; <span class="smcap">God</span> said that it should stay, and it stayed;
there was the miracle. To have set the Creation going
two thousand years before in such a way and train that in
that hour a cloud should rise to refract the sun's rays for
a time, because in that hour the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>'s armies would need
the interference, the prolonging of the daylight,&mdash;that was
miracle enough. We say not that <span class="smcap">God</span> interrupts His own
laws; nay, rather we believe that He hath them always in
smooth and orderly operation. Similarly of Inspiration; we
know not the way in which <span class="smcap">God</span> acts on human minds, the
Spirit on the spirit; for He hath not told us. But, as I said
in the beginning, in an age like the present, where analysis
of process is the work of men's minds, the way in which man
is feeling his strength in every direction, it is not very unnatural
that the operations of this philosophy should have
been carried beyond their due line; into the subject, namely,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>of the secret communication between the Divine Spirit, and
the spirit and apprehensions of Men, i.e. the Work of Inspiration.
To accept the Bible as the word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, just as
a cottager or a child in a village school accepts it, is an
inglorious thing. He whose intellect is his instrument, that
which he is to work with, wishes to feel his intellect operating
on any subject which he has to meet. He feels a desire, in
apprehending a thing as done, to have as part of his apprehension,
a view of how it is done, more or less. It is natural
to him to take what he feels to be an intelligent view of a
subject. In accepting the Bible therefore as the Word of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, he must have a view as to <i>how</i> it is the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>;
the nature of the illapse which the Spirit from on high
makes on the spirit and faculties of the man. In a word, he
would get between the Creator, and man to whom the Creator
speaks; and <i>there</i> would make his observations. But how
little encouragement have we to do this in the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>!
When <span class="smcap">God</span> sent prophets to speak to men, to convey a message
to them from their Maker, or when He tells Apostles to
speak to us, doth He invite us to come within the veil with
our philosophy, and examine? I shall offend the piety of
those who hear me by pursuing the thought. But I cannot
but think that something of this kind has been done by
those who have presented us with theories of Inspiration,
setting forth to us that which it cannot be shewn that <span class="smcap">God</span>
hath set forth to them, or to any one. Yes, they are right;
our Creator makes use of our faculties; and when He hath
given to one man faculties different from those given to
another, faculties of whatever kind, of intellectual power or
of moral temperament, He employs them all. Hath He
a message of Love? He employs a St. John to utter it, and
to prolong the delightful note. Hath He a message of freedom,
that liberty wherewith <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hath made us free?
He hath a Paul ready to accept and to fulfil the congenial
errand. But <span class="smcap">God</span> speaks, not man; and they who would
have us be dwelling on the Human Element, when <span class="smcap">God</span>
invites us to be lost in the Divine, are doing not well. Yes,
<span class="smcap">God</span> employs all our faculties: He hath made us different,
as He made the flowers of the field different, and Christianity
shews us why He hath so made us; because He hath a work
for each of us to do,&mdash;a work which none else could do so
well. Doubtless He employs all our faculties, doing violence
to none. This doubtless is His glory, that He can bring
about His results by the means which He Himself hath
made. Who has not felt, in reading some sacred narrative,
the history, e.g. of Joseph, that the wonderful part of it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>this, how naturally all came about,&mdash;all by natural operation
of human motives and man's free will? So in Inspiration.
No doubt <span class="smcap">God</span>'s instruments which He hath made are enough
for His work; no doubt He employs men as they are; not
their tongues only, but their minds and spirits, acting on
them and employing them as they are. Only in that great
process, the point which I call attention to is this,&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span>
speaks of it as divine, and fixes the thought of those who
hear Him on the divine element: we, dropping our view on
the human, are not wise. He shews us providence; He
condescends to shew us His work: we do not well when
we shew an interest rather in lower parts of the scheme,
especially when in those we may so greatly err, having
so little information."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>, by the Rev. C.&nbsp;P. Eden,

<p>[<i>How the Inspired authors of the New Testament handle the
writings of the Inspired authors of the Old.</i>]</p>


<p>"Let me repeat:&mdash;The question is, how we should address
ourselves to the study of the sacred page? For example,
how am I to regard, and how to deal with, the great diversities
there are between the several sacred writers? For
there is the greatest diversity of mind appearing between
them. St. Paul is no more the same with St. John, than any
two good men now are perfectly alike in their constitution
of mind. Nay, the diversity seems especially great in the
case of the sacred writers: as if to forbid us to adopt any
theory which should ignore or neglect that diversity. It is
striking. How shall I deal with these and like circumstances?...
Can it be suggested to me what a good and
wise man would do in this matter?</p>

<p>"In answer; it can apparently be suggested; and through
that which is the best and safest of arguments, the argument
from analogy. For there has been a parallel case; the case
of the <i>inspired writers of the New Testament dealing with the
Scriptures of the Old</i>. To this parallel I now invite your
attention. If we can observe how and upon what great
principles, piety and wisdom, guided by Inspiration, dealt
with the volume of the Holy Scriptures which were then its
whole volume, namely the Old Testament; we have so far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>forth a parallel case to the case of Christians now. The first
Christians looked back on the Old Testament as their sacred
Scriptures. If we can discern how they regarded their sacred
volume, and how they proceeded in interpreting it, we have
a pattern to guide us in regard of the question, how we shall
regard the sacred volume, and how proceed in the study and
interpretation of it; they with the Bible that they had,&mdash;we
with the Bible that we have, the completed volume.&mdash;In
this point of view I cannot but regard it as most distinctly
providential that there are introduced in the pages of the
New Testament so many quotations from the pages of the
Old. For they furnish us with an answer applicable in every
age of the Church to the question, How shall piety and
wisdom deal with a sacred volume; that volume being from
the pen of many writers; but with this aggravated difficulty
in the former case, that the writers there were widely separated
from one another in point of time, were in contact
therefore with most difficult forms of life and stages of
society? How in approaching a volume so originated, did
the New Testament writers regard and deal with its contents?"&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>,
by the Rev. C.&nbsp;P. Eden, pp.&nbsp;183-5.</p>

<p>"And it is impossible for us to imagine,&mdash;I say the
thoughtful reader of the Holy Scriptures will find it impossible
to imagine,&mdash;an Evangelist or Apostle, evoking out
of its grave the Human Element of the ancient prophetic
communications; disinterring it once more as if to gaze upon
it. I am sure the impression left on the mind by the passages
in the New Testament where the Old is referred to, is
in accordance with what I say. In other words,&mdash;(for it is
but in other words the same,)&mdash;these divinely instructed
students,&mdash;these inspired readers of the sacred page,&mdash;are
aware of that which they read, being inspired; <span class="smcap">God</span> its
author, and not Man. And they shew this consciousness,
putting off their shoes from their feet, as if on holy ground.
A divinely instructed mind, interprets a divinely indited
Scripture; the Spirit His own interpreter; and we are
taught,&mdash;not by man but by the Author of Inspiration,&mdash;how
Inspiration is to be dealt with.&mdash;Let him who would
deal aright with the sacred pages of the New Covenant,
observe in due seriousness what instruction he may gain from
the consideration now suggested to his thoughts. Let him
learn from the sacred page, how to deal with the sacred
page. And if he has observed these things; if he has seen
how the writers of the New Testament, discern in lines and
words of the Old Testament, that which speaks to <i>them</i>,&mdash;(for
it speaks to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and in Him to His Church, i.e. to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
them:) ... how these utterers of inspired sounds are found,
when their words receive at length an authentic interpretation,
to have been speaking of the Christian Church, its
terms of Salvation, its spiritual gifts;&mdash;a reader of the Holy
Scriptures practised in these observations will have learned
in some measure <i>how</i> to approach the sacred volume; with
a sense not only of its unfathomed depth, but also of its
unity of scope; and a conscious interest rather in its universal
truths,&mdash;its ever present truths,&mdash;than in those transitory
imports which some of its pages can be shewn to have had,
over and above their Evangelical meaning."&mdash;(<i>Ibid.</i>, pp.

Nam f[oe]dus cum Jud&aelig;is sancitum, (Deut. xxix., <i>et seq.</i>, in quo

Paulus verba ista manifesto alleget ut ipsissima verba justiti&aelig;

<i>Atque, ut verum fatear, semper existimavi, allusiones istas (ad

in quo gratiam illam efficacissimam vobis adstipulaturus
sit. Eandem autem cordis circumcisionem procul dubio
designant verba Jeremi&aelig;, v. 33, pr&aelig;d. cap.; 'Indam legem
meam menti eorum, et cordi eorum inscribam eam.' Porro
remissio ista omnium peccatorum, qu&aelig; p[oe]nitentibus promittitur

exprimitur pr&aelig;dicti cap. ver 34. 'Ero propitius iniquitatibus
eorum, et peccatorum ipsorum et transgressionum ipsorum
non recordabor amplius.' Denique Jeremias claritatem ostendit

f[oe]dere continebantur, ob quam Dei populo non opus esset
laboriosa disquisitione, aut exactiori disciplina, ut pr&aelig;cepta

<p>[<i>Opinions of Commentators concerning Accommodation.</i>]</p>


<p>Cornelius &agrave; Lapide, on this place, writes us follows:&mdash;
"Licet Cajetanus, Adamus, Pererius, Toletus, putent Mosem
ad litteram loqui de Christo et Christi justiti&acirc;, referunt enim
h&aelig;c ejus verba ad p[oe]nitentiam, de qua eodem capite egerat
Moses, ver. 1; (P[oe]nitentia enim et dilectio Dei, ac consequenter
peccatorum venia, ipsaque justitia sine fide Christi
haberi non potest;) tamen <i>longe planius est, ut non litteraliter,
sed allegorice tantum alludat Apostolus ad Mosem. Moses enim
ad litteram, sive in sensu litterati loquitur, non de Christo ejusque
Evangelio, sed de lege data Jud&aelig;is, ut patet eum intuenti</i>.
Ita Chrysostomus, Theodoretus, Theophylactus, [OE]cumenius,
Abulensis, Soto.... H&aelig;c, inquam verba, Mosem ad suos
Jud&aelig;os literaliter loqui plan&egrave; certum, evidens, et manifestum
est; ita tamen ut eadem h&aelig;c ejus verba <i>allegorice Evangelio
ejusque catechumenis et fidelibus optime conveniant</i>. &AElig;que enim,
immo magis, ad manum est omnibus jam Evangelium et fides
Christi, quam olim fuerit lex Mosis: ita ut fidem hanc omnes
facillime corde, id est mente, complecti: et ore proloqui, itaque
justificari et salvari possint."</p>

<p>Our own learned Hammond writes as follows:&mdash;"The two
phrases of 'going up into Heaven,' or 'descending into the
deep,' are proverbial phrases to signify the doing or attempting
to do some hard, impossible thing.... These
phrases had been of old used by Moses in this sense, Deut.
xxx. 12." [And then, the place follows.] "Which words
being used by Moses to express the easiness and readiness of
the way which the Jews had to know their duty and to perform
it, are here by the Apostle <i>accommodated</i> to express the
easiness of the Gospel condition, above that of the Mosaical
Law."&mdash;So far Dr. Hammond; whose notion that there was
any accommodation here, I altogether deny. As for his
belief that the paraphrase in the Targum of Jerusalem,
["Utinam esset nobis aliquis Propheta, Jon&aelig; similis, qui in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
profundum maris magni descenderet,"] is the "ground of
St. Paul's application" of the place to the Death and Resurrection
of Christ, I can but feel surprised to find such a view
advocated by so learned a man, and so excellent a Divine.
But it is not Hammond's way to write thus. In his "Practical
Catechism," he often expounds similar Scripture, (e.g.
St. Luke i. 72-5,) after a very lofty fashion.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;"Hunc locum accommodavit ad causam suam
B. Paulus, Rom. x. Nam cum proprie hic locus pertineat
ad Decalogum, transfertur eleganter et erudite a Paulo ad
fidem qu&aelig; os requirit ut promulgetur, et cor ut corde credamus."&mdash;Fagius,
ad Deut. xxx. 11, apud <i>Criticos Sacros</i>.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, we meet with a directly different
gloss:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Locum hunc divinus Paulus divine de Evangelica pr&aelig;dicatione
ac sermone fidei est interpretatus, tametsi sensum
magis, ut &aelig;quum est, quam textum ad verbum expresserit;
ut illius etiam alibi est mos. Satis enim fuit, atque adeo
magis consentaneum viris Spiritu Dei plenis significare quid
idem Spiritus in Scriptura intelligi vellet."&mdash;Clavius, ad Deut.
xxx. 14, apud <i>Criticos Sacros</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning the general principle of Accommodation, (as
explained above, p.&nbsp;188,) the following passages present
themselves as valuable.</p>

<p>"Men have suggested that these things were accommodations
of the Sacred Writers; and that the New Testament
Writers, in the interpretations they gave of passages in the
Old, meant to say, that the texts <i>might</i> be applied in such
way as they applied them. But the suggestors of this view
can hardly have considered carefully those conversations of
our Blessed <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> with His disciples going to Emmaus;
and afterward in the evening of the same day, in which He
distinctly reprehends them for their dulness of heart in not
seeing in the pages of the Old Testament the predictions of
His Death and of His Resurrection; though, of His Resurrection
the intimations are, in those ancient Scriptures, to
our view so scanty and obscure. He unfolds to them as they
walk the reference of the Old Testament Scriptures to Himself.
Then in a later interview He resumes the instruction
and 'opens their understanding,' (it is said,) to discover
the same; the relation of the Old Testament Scriptures
(namely) to Himself.&mdash;He is a bold Commentator who having
seen the Disciples thus instructed,&mdash;having witnessed this
scene,&mdash;then, when he meets with these same Disciples' interpretations
of the ancient Scriptures in relation to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
calls them 'Accommodations,' and gives them to a human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>original. But I ask leave to turn from this theory."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>
by the Rev. C.&nbsp;P. Eden, pp.&nbsp;189&mdash;190.</p>

<p>"If we believe that the Apostles were inspired, then all
idea of accommodation must be renounced.... The theory of
Accommodation, i.e. of erroneous interpretation of the Scripture,
cannot be thought of without imputing error to the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of Truth and Holiness; or to Him who sent the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> to recal to the minds of the Apostles all things which
He had said to them, and to guide them into all Truth."&mdash;From
a Sermon by Dr. M'Caul, <i>The Hope of the Gospel the
Hope of the Old Testament Saints</i>, (1854,)&mdash;p.&nbsp;8.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's notes:</h3>

<ul>
<li> The preface and the main essay on "Essays and Reviews" are both numbered
in Roman numerals starting at i. The former pages have been tagged with
"Preface_Page_i" etc. </li>
<li>Footnotes have been renumbered to run from 1 through the book. Where
   there is reference to a particular footnote in the text, the original
   text has been left, but [our 330] inserted to advise what the reference
   now is.
</li>
<li>
The author's unusual punctuation style has been preserved, notably in
   the following respects.
<ul>
<li> Footnote markers appear before punctuation.</li>
<li> Punctuation appears before closing parentheses.</li>
<li> When a quotation is followed by a page reference, the page reference
     is normally followed by the same punctuation as the quotation ended
     with.</li>
<li> Roman numerals used for numbering are sometimes followed by a period,
sometimes not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> The use of hyphenation in the book is inconsistent. Where words were
   hyphenated at the end of a line, other examples in the text have been
   followed. Cases where there was some doubt were "pre-existing" (p. li),
    "co-extensive" (p. lxxvi), "frostwork" (p. cxxii), "overrule" (p. 20),
    and "twofold" (p. 38).
</li>
<li> i.e., and e.g., have been standardised to have no space.</li>
<li> The following words are either archaic spellings or typographical
   errors and have been left as in the original. Those known to the
   transcriber as valid archaic spellings have been marked [*]
<ul>
<li> "Pourtrays/pourtrayed" (p. xxv)</li>
<li> "recal" for "recall" (p. xxviii and others)</li>
<li>  "inuendo" (p. liv) [*]</li>
<li> "præ-Adamic" (p. cvii)</li>
<li> "Meanwile" (p. cxii)</li>
<li> "expence" (p. cxxxiii) [*]</li>
